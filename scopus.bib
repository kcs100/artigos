	abstract = {Pedagogical foundations exist for incorporating technology in instruction; however, these foundations have not kept pace with technology's evolution. Through the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), students now can share content directed at external audiences, i.e., audiences other than the instructor. These audiences are referred to as authentic audiences as they are public-facing and exist outside of the classroom. The existing literature offers evidence of student satisfaction with assignments directed at appealing to external audiences, however, the literature provides no comprehensive pedagogical rationale for assignments directed at authentic audiences wherein the goals are self-determined. The authors discuss the theory of heutagogy, the study of self-determined learning, as an approach for assessing assignments that utilize ICTs and are directed at authentic audiences. Finally, the authors offer an approach for the assessment of these assignments, including a rubric. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 advancements in technology are creating a dynamic and fast changing world that affects how we live and work. Educators need to rethink existing teaching approaches to better prepare learners for future careers that Industry 4.0 will create. The World Economic Forum defined a new education model, called Education 4.0, which contains eight major changes to redefine learning in the new economy. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is an approach that promotes critical thinking, social-emotional skills, and life-long learning. These skills are necessary for Education 4.0. The purpose of this paper is to recommend the principles of heutagogy as an effective teaching and learning approach to meet the needs of Education 4.0. The approach of the study examines existing literature on Education 4.0 and heutagogy. A conceptual model that interconnects heutagogy to the four learning principles of Education 4.0 will be offered as a key finding to answer the research question: How does heutagogy in higher online education meet the needs of Education 4.0? The paper provides a base for further research and discussion into how heutagogy and other approaches can support the needs of Education 4.0 to prepare learners for a changing world. © 2022, Canadian Network for Innovation in Education.

	abstract = {Mobile Heutagogy (M-Heutagogy) is the teaching practice that emphasizes self-determined learning and student autonomy. Many teachers and academicians have applied M-Heutagogy in their teaching and learning in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The purpose of this study is to synthesize an empirical literature review of the M-Heutagogical practice among Higher Education students and its acceptance. The main objective of this paper is to review the literature on M-Heutagogy practice and its acceptance among Higher Education students. The researcher conducted a systematic review of 60 articles for the period 2007 to 2020. The findings indicate that M-Heutagogy has been applied in HEIs around the world with the support of emergent technologies and mobile applications. Unfortunately, only two M-Heutagogy acceptance studies have been done so far. Future research suggested that the M-Heutagogy acceptance model should be developed to be referred by researchers while doing an acceptance study. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Preparing students for the complex and changing nature of the workforce has become an overriding objective within higher education. New pedagogies, which incorporate both informal and formal learning and support personalization of learning, are central to this objective. Educators are required to reassess the use of traditional pedagogies, as they attempt to foster development of skills and competencies for lifelong learning. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is a learning theory that addresses this need, giving students agency in determining what and how they learn. The theory is based in the principles of learner agency, capability and self-efficacy, reflection and metacognition, and non-linear learning, and when used with technology can be a powerful instructional approach for building students’ self-directed and lifelong learning skills. A compelling example of this is the e-portfolio. As a platform and assessment tool, the e-portfolio spans the spectrum of lifelong learning, as well as encompasses both formal and informal learning of the individual learner and addresses critical aspects of learning and reflection, showcasing the learner’s acquired skills and competencies. Based on successful cases in the literature, this article discusses the principles of heutagogy, the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH continuum) and its application in online learning environments, and the use of the e-portfolio in further cultivating and advancing self-determined learning. The article also offers recommendations for future practice and theory. © 2020 Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study was initiated to address the limited bibliometric analyses on heutagogy, despite its growing prominence in higher education as a learner-centered, self-determined approach. As the field gains momentum, understanding its research landscape is essential for guiding future pedagogical practices and scholarship. We conducted a bibliometric review of 290 publications from 2005 to 2024 indexed in the Scopus database, applying PRISMA guidelines and defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. VOSviewer was used to analyze citation networks, co-authorship patterns, and keyword co-occurrences. Findings show a significant increase in publications, peaking in 2020, with Blaschke identified as the most cited author and Cochrane as the most prolific. Auckland University led institutional contributions. The research spans disciplines such as education, computer science, and business, with thematic focuses on educational technology, lifelong learning, and 21st-century skills. However, collaboration remains largely regional, indicating opportunities for broader international engagement. The review highlights heutagogy's growing impact on flexible and technology-enhanced learning environments. These insights have practical implications for curriculum development, instructional design, and educational policy. Conclusively, heutagogy is poised to play a transformative role in higher education, particularly in promoting autonomy, adaptability, and lifelong learning. Future research should expand global collaboration heutagogical practices. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {With the swift pivot to online learning, teachers and students have been forced to adopt a new way of teaching and learning, which has required students to become more self-directed in their learning. In addition, teachers are faced with the challenge of preparing students for the workforce and lifelong learning. One emerging approach for addressing both these challenges is that of heutagogy, or self-determined learning. This paper discusses the rising demand for lifelong learning skills and the role that heutagogy can play in supporting students in developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Specifically, the paper presents a case study of a higher education institution that has introduced heutagogy, using interviews with programme leaders/instructors to investigate how a college in Israel incorporated heutagogy into their master's education programmes. Case study results reveal that there are challenges in incorporating heutagogy (eg, difficulty for students in adopting the approach), but once adopted, students preferred learning in a self-determined way. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? Lifelong learning skills are critical to student employability, and there is a need for exploring new theories and approaches for developing these skills. The current pandemic has forced traditional learning into the online space, requiring more self-directed learning skills in learners. Heutagogy has been identified as a net-centric teaching and learning theory for online learning. What this paper adds Positions heutagogy for use in traditional and online classroom settings in order to develop learners' self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Explores the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum and its use as an instructional strategy. Presents a case study of a higher education institution that has implemented self-determined learning. Implications for practice and/or policy This study encourages further research into use of heutagogy for developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills. This study provides guidance for those who want to introduce self-determined learning into classroom settings. © 2021 British Educational Research Association.},

Bloom's taxonomy has been used to define taxonomic levels in learning since the 1950's; "create" is one of its highest taxonomic levels. It can be difficult to create relevant, authentic assessments that require students to display both synthesis of meaning, as well creative synthesis of concepts learned to reach this "create" level in an effective manner. Transformative learning and especially heutagogy or "self-determined learning" can be used as theoretical curriculum models or frameworks to help students learn and solve problems. These two theories are particularly effective when leveraged with technology. Today's instructional technologies allow students to more readily create and explore new concepts on their own to generate a more fulfilling education process with meaningful relevant practice and assessment. © 2021 by IGI Global.

	abstract = {The gender digital divide (GDD) is a social phenomenon that denies citizens access to technologies, the internet, and the services associated with Education 4.0. Reducing this gap requires communicative literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which emphasize the use of technology, self-determined learning, and collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the participation of 124 Mexican students of technical-professional education. The study’s objective was to analyze how they scaled their communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico. Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic thinking (z = –2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly higher mean (M = 25.36) than men (M = 25.11). Qualitative results support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90%). This suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively enhance communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they can be spaces where both women and men achieve similar levels of digital literacy. © 2024 The Author(s).},
