	abstract = {Teaching and learning in higher education is informed by a multitude of conditioning factors, not least the values systems and outlook of academics. Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by academics in relation to teaching and learning is therefore important if we are to make judgments about how we educate now, and could do so in the future. Developments in educational theory and digital technology have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in which students learn, and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses from universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has attracted interest from those who wish to see greater student control over the learning journey- but how widespread is this view amongst academics? This paper reports on a qualitative study in which 12 academics in an English Business School were asked to describe their views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate through the concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is little epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are going to innovate, then additional resource and professional development should be put in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in their epistemological positioning. The paper conceptualises academics’ positioning through a typology of epistemic views. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

	abstract = {Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) pedagogy refers to principles, methods, and practices used in teaching and learning vocational skills. TVET is focused on preparing individuals for the world of work by acquiring practical skills and knowledge. In recent years, pedagogical approaches toward flexible learning have been integrated. The teaching design in higher education nowadays enhances learning outcomes and prepares learners for the 21st-century workplace. Three pedagogical approaches were selected in designing the concept of TVET teaching strategy and integrated based on heutagogy, peeragogy, and cybergogy. Heutagogy encourages self-directed learning, while peeragogy fosters collaboration and learning from each other. Cybergogy uses digital technology to integrate TVET education, equipping students with knowledge, skills, and attitudes to thrive in the digital age and prepare them for future jobs. The concept of Heuta-Peera-Cyber was proposed after careful analysis of literature and past research. The result shows the principles of heutagogy can be linked with collaboration with peers and implementing technology to improve and develop learning experiences. In summary, by providing the resources for learning, the concept of teaching design can help to invent a more engaging, effective, and enjoyable learning experience. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Muhammad Mujtaba Asad, Prathamesh Padmakar Churi, Fahad Sherwani, and Razali Bin Hassan.
