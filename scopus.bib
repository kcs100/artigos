	abstract = {Introduction: The needs of today’s higher education have changed and higher education does not need a one-way communication from teacher to student but rather learn to appreciate the new role of the teacher as a facilitator with mutual responsibilities toward the creation of knowledge. Heutagogy, which emphasizes learner autonomy and the creation of self-determined learners, has garnered attention as a potential solution to address the evolving needs of teacher preparation. However, empirical research on the beliefs and attitudes of Heutagogy within the teacher education context remains limited. This study aimed to fill this gap by exploring the beliefs and attitudes of lecturers and pre-service teachers of the School of Education and Life-Long Learning (SoELL) at SDD-UBIDS. Methods: Convergent mixed method design with both quantitative and qualitative data analysis, the study collected both quantitative and qualitative data on 513 Pre-service teachers and 30 Lecturers from SoELL, SDD-UBIDS using a four-point Likert scale questionnaire and interview. Results: The findings revealed diverse perspectives among Lecturers and Pre-service Teachers regarding Heutagogy, with varying levels of understanding, acceptance, and readiness for implementation. Lecturers expressed enthusiasm for Heutagogy’s potential to foster learner autonomy and critical thinking skills, while pre-service teachers demonstrated varying levels of readiness and comfort with self-directed learning approaches. Discussion: Lecturers and Pre-service teachers expressed willingness to embrace a self-determined approach in which the learner reflects on what is learned and how it is learned and where the Lecturers teach the learners how to learn by themselves. The cognitive conflict and the inadequacy of pre-service teachers’ preparedness will necessitate a shift in their attitudes toward developing autonomy skills to effectively navigate the challenges of the 21st-century knowledge economy.

	abstract = {Recently, within the higher education system in the United Kingdom, there has been close examination of the way institutions teach and assess students. This scrutiny has been intensified by central government with the proposed introduction of the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF). The anticipated TEF demands that higher education institutions evaluate their teaching and learning practices and think of new ways to develop excellent student experience. Self-determined learning has resurfaced as a popular approach in the higher education sector. At the centre of self-determined learning is the concept of heutagogy. This approach enables the student to apply what they have learned in an education setting and relate it to the workplace. The aim of this paper is to critically explore the theoretical framework behind the self-determined learning approach. The authors of this paper argue that, from a social science perspective, a determined learning approach is in the best place to provide a contemporary, exciting teaching and learning experience in a competitive higher education market. © 2016, © 2016 The Author(s).

The first part of the book presents the philosophical, psychological and sociological foundations of heutagogy, and describes lessons learned from prior experiences of its implementation. The second part presents a collaborative self-study of five heutagogy courses in higher education. The third discusses how the academic community can enhance the paradigm change, and compares heutagogy to similar academic approaches. The concluding chapter of the book explores the question of "what next"? and suggests some possible elaborations of heutagogy. "At the beginning, it was very difficult for me to appreciate the course's mode of learning. All my life I had learned in a traditional manner. Occasionally I felt that I was being thrown into deep water without a lifeguard. ... But as the course progressed, I succeeded in letting go of my deeply rooted habits and discovered a new learning approach, through which I found in myself a new learner..." (Student's reflection) "...this book suggests a novel approach to learning and education and will become a widely read one."

	abstract = {An increasing number of neurodivergent learners attend higher education. This necessitates examination of best-fit learning models to successfully support the current generation of college students. While pedagogy and andragogy have historical relevance, in isolation, they may lack alignment with the individualization embedded in neurodiversity-affirming practice. This study conceptualized a novel learning framework for neurodivergent college students through the lens of neurodiversity-affirming practice. Via constant comparative qualitative analysis of American university faculty interviews and framework juxtaposition, three themes were identified: pedagogy vs. andragogy, self-determination, and interdependency. Thematic analysis revealed uncertainty regarding best-fit learning framework, with consensus reached regarding complexity of serving neurodivergent adults in post-secondary settings. An innovative framework titled “Building a Heutagogical Bridge” was envisioned, describing the role of heutagogy, student-centered, self-determined learning, in connecting signature pedagogical and andragogical approaches. This study revealed the potentiality of implementing and assessing approaches to skillfully incorporate heutagogical, pedagogical, and andragogical principles in higher education settings. The perspectives of faculty from the USA within this study can inform neurodiversity-affirming practice in American universities, while providing implications for future study and practice in international college settings, where contexts, needs, and culture may differ. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2023.},

Facilitating professional development for lecturers to engage with innovation in teaching and learning utilizing new technologies is no simple process. However, we have found that structuring lecturer professional development around a sustained community of practice can result in a journey of conceptual and pedagogical transformation [1]. The increasing ubiquity of mobile devices and social media provides a platform for enabling pedagogical change. Thus we established a MOBile Community Of Practice (MOBCOP) of lecturers interested in researching the potential of mobile social media in education interested in exploring the concept of the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum [2], and how mobile learning can be utilized as a catalyst [3] to move towards student-directed heutagogy. We argue that the MOPCOP framework is potentially applicable to a variety of higher education contexts. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Students in higher education are using mobile devices, which challenges our understanding of what it means to learn in modern environments. By using mobile devices as instruc-tional aids, students gain a variety of social, cognitive, and technical abilities. Mobile devices may therefore be seen as supporting the growth of employability skills and broader lifelong learning, both of which may be helpful in a variety of circumstances. The quickly evolving landscape of technology and education presented teachers with a number of challenges, and they had to retrain and refresh their skills in order to provide practical training. As a result, heutagogical methods are ideal for enhancing their collective knowledge and skills. Online and blended learning (BL) offer a learning environment that incorporates technological affordances to facilitate learning. This enables the growth of an independent, capable, and self-directed lifelong learner. Heutagogy provides an educational strategy in this context that may link the development of lifelong learning competencies with BL and online learning environments. Using this methodology, we investigate the potential contribution of online and blended higher education to technology-enabled lifelong learning where heutagogical experiences are available. The results support the notion that heutagogy and lifelong learning are linked by some basic concepts that apply to both mixed and online learning environments. © 2024 by the authors of this article.},

	abstract = {By the 21st century, education system in the world should prepare its citizens who are not merely knowledgeable but have multidimensional skills in facing globalization and future careers. In this context, various new pedagogical concepts appear: heutagogy, paragogy and cybergogy. In line with this development, educators are urged to implement the pedagogical transformations to use these new concepts. Review of literature shows that there are currently no criteria of heutagogy, paragogy or cybergogy that can be used as a guide in designing teaching and learning, especially in learning mathematics. Therefore, the objective of this study will specifically generate the themes and its' items for heutagogy criteria. Intensive document analyses were done related to teaching and learning models, several Malaysian higher education policy documents, best practices in effective learning environments both locally and abroad in general and in the field of mathematics education, as well as the literature review on aspect of heutagogical approach. The finding of the study revealed six themes for the heutagogical criteria in teaching and learning of mathematics, namely (i)Learner-defined learning contracts, (ii) Learner is the main person in forming a flexible curriculum, (iii) Learner-directed questions, (iv) Flexible and negotiated assessment (v) Reflective practice and, (vi) Collaborative learning. Significantly, these criteria provide a useful guide for instructors or lecturers to critically analyze each of the items and to better support students in learning mathematics for creating human capital with features such as flexible, creative, innovative and good problem solvers to meet the challenges for the future. © 2020 Horizon Research Publishing.

Although the discussion and solutions presented focus primarily on nursing education, other health and social care professions face similar challenges and consequently the recommendations presented are transferable and applicable to other groups. It is widely accepted that mentoring enhances the learning experience for all participants, and existing literature suggests there is little doubt that peer mentorship will contribute positively to the undergraduate‘s experience in higher education. Two methods are consistent with a heutagogical approach to learning namely: solution-focused learning and mentor-assisted learning. A shift in thinking and practice towards heutagogy will enable the learner, with the support of mentor-assisted learning and a solution-focused approach, to develop space. The learner becomes an architect of their own learning and mentoring enables learners to learn about the nature of understanding and their role in making knowledge, inspiring them to develop their spiritual practice. © 2017 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of higher education and adult learning, asynchronous video-based online learning has not only become the new norm but has also emerged as the cornerstone of instructional delivery for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Despite its widespread adoption, this learning mode confronts a critical challenge: the inherent lack of social presence, posing a significant risk of diminishing learner affective engagement and, consequently, jeopardizing the efficacy of learning outcomes. Addressing this pressing issue, our study conducted a comprehensive analysis of 240 instructional videos from 240 distinct instructors on a MOOC platform, supplemented by 845 post-course learner feedback surveys from a diverse cohort of college students and adult learners. Using deep learning and statistical analysis, the research revealed that the on-screen presence of instructors does not inherently affect students’ affective engagement. The study revealed that learners’ affective engagement is affected by distinct combinations of the instructor’s facial and paraverbal expressions, including happiness, surprise, and anger, which vary depending on whether the instructor is visible. The discovery that vocal attractiveness is a pivotal element in enhancing learners’ affective engagement with instructional videos marks a paradigm shift in our understanding of digital andragogy and heutagogy. This study propels academic discourse by illuminating the critical role of instructor non-verbal cues in establishing social presence and facilitating emotional contagion within asynchronous video-based online learning but also provides educators and content creators with empirically-backed techniques to revolutionize video instruction and amplify affective engagement. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: Self-directed learning or self-determined learning can be used in guided self-study (GSS) as an educational method with the goal to promote changes in the knowledge and skills of undergraduate physiotherapy students in higher education. Until now, there has been a lack of empirical evidence for the usage of GSS in physiotherapy higher education. At the Division of Physiotherapy in the Department of Health Professions (Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH), Switzerland) the module ‘basic examination’–in the form of an objective structured examination (OSCE) and written exam–is scheduled in the first semester of the educational program. Objective: The primary aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of establishing GSS in an undergraduate physiotherapy degree program at the BFH. Secondary aim is to assess the effectiveness of GSS on the examination skills of first-semester undergraduate physiotherapy students will. Method: This paper describes the protocol of a randomized group-controlled educational feasibility study. 51 physiotherapy students from the first semester will be allocated into a guided self-study group (GSSG) or control group. The GSS takes place during the first semester, and consists of an eight-day cycle, with a presentation on the last day. Duration of this presentation is 90 min with supervision from a university lecturer. One week in advance of the presentation, the case and the learning goals are provided to the students electronically. The students prepare the cases in groups of five to six. The students are guided by the tutor during this preparation time. During a moderated plenum session, students present the results of group work and reflect upon the preparation phase and learning steps. Feasibility outcomes include the fidelity of implementation through exposure dosage, students’ responsiveness, program differentiation, and the degree of acceptability. Success criteria of feasibility are (1) exposure dosage as the number of 90-minute presentations that are conducted, and the content of cases and competences, (2) students’ responsiveness, with the aim of 100% willingness to participate, and (3) program differentiation, which will illustrate the alignment between GSS case content and the curriculum. Acceptability of intervention from the students’ perspective will be evaluated by a semi-structured interview. Secondary outcomes will be the achieved grades in the OSCE exams and written exams that demonstrate learning success. Conclusion: This feasibility study assesses the fidelity of implementation, the degree of acceptability and the effectiveness of GSS sessions on examination skills in undergraduate physiotherapy students at the BFH. Furthermore, this study will demonstrate whether guided self-study is feasible and can be implemented with fidelity in the BFH physiotherapy higher education curriculum. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose This study of affordances in educational technology focuses on how the selfperceptions of teachers influence the creation of educational opportunities and how these are received by learners. Background It is important to explore the affordances offered by teachers, when using educational technology, from the perspective of their students. Within this topic, the interface of the educational technology affordances with the two agents—teachers and students—has often been neglected. Hence, the learning possibilities in educational interactions for the learners cannot be separated from the interactional possibilities created by teachers. The extent to which teachers can create opportunities to address their students’ needs, while effectively conveying the value of these opportunities to their students, is likely to impact on how well these affordances for learning and collaboration are utilised. Methodology A survey that includes two questionnaires was used. The questionnaires were circulated to 102 teachers and their 354 adult students in six higher education institutions in Oman. The questionnaires were analysed by SPSS Amos v20 for statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation. Contribution The study contributes to the field of e-learning because it demonstrates that the affordances offered by teachers for e-learning have an impact on the possibilities for students to engage. Both affordances were found to be highly correlated statistically. Further, teachers were found to primarily use the lowest level of engagement for online tasks, requiring low levels of cognitive challenge and social involvement from the learner. Findings The results indicate a low to medium level of self-directed learning that significantly correlates with perceptions of teaching possibilities for learning interactions. Recommendations for Practitioners Teachers are encouraged to vary approaches to student engagement in online teaching materials such as enhancement, additional engagement opportunities, and extension so that students are encouraged to use different cognitive abilities and capabilities to engage in social interactions. Impact on Society This study presents a strong recommendation with regards to extending the online affordances towards social interactions of learning beyond the boundary of the classroom. Future Research Further studies on e-heutagogy and affordances of both teachers and students are needed. The effect of teachers created opportunities on students learning actions is an area that grants further investigation. © This article is licensed to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.

Academagogy is an amalgamation of learning theories, viz. pedagogy (teacher-centered learning); andragogy (student-centered learning); and, heutagogy (self-determined learning). 10;While the original paper by McAuliffe et al. focused on the application of Academagogical principles to higher education in a university, this case study extends Academagogy into corporate training. Design/methodology/approach: Academagogy-based learning interventions were implemented in training programs conducted at IIC Academy. The study-sample comprised 144 trainees divided into the experiment and the control groups. Academagogical interventions were applied to the experiment group, whereas the control group followed conventional methods. Controlled quasi-experiment and statistical analyses were used as research tools in this case study. Findings: The performance scores of the participants' at entry-level were analyzed through propensity score matching and chi-square tests. The results concluded that the experiment and the control group had no selection bias. 10; 10;The treatment effect applied to the experiment group was studied using scatter-plots and effect size analyses. 10; 10;The results indicate that the academagogical interventions markedly improved behavioral and professional skills among participants of the experiment group, which showed up in their superior performance, both during training and at work. Research limitations/implications: This case study has two major limitations, viz. the sample population was homogenous; the batch-size was limited to 15 participants, which facilitated closer monitoring of the course. Originality/value: Academagogical interventions were implemented in a corporate setting as opposed to earlier studies which focused on a university setting and academic environs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Background: Social media is a ubiquitous phenomenon that serves as a tool for communication, collaboration, and creativity. In the long term, it has an indispensable place in the field of education. The research paper discusses the use of certain social networking sites where learning management systems are extensively and consistently used in the teaching and learning process at universities. The rapid transition to online platforms had a tremendous impact on the educational process, exposing and promoting the effectiveness of heutagogy. The circumstances made it necessary to emphasize the value of self-directed learning and the capacity to identify educational requirements and strategies for reaching study objectives. This kind of research corresponds to the increased need to develop desired self-study skills in students. Objectives: The goal of the paper is to demonstrate how undergraduate students perceive the trends in acceptance and the degree of appropriateness of social media for academic purposes. Methods: Research on social media use in education was inspired by a review of the literature. The purpose of the questionnaire is to track awareness, use, general satisfaction, communication, testing, and revision. The set of social media examined in the survey (years 2021 and 2022) was modified to reflect the social media landscape at the time. This study compares the findings of four different studies. The outcomes are displayed in graphs. Results: Two areas are analyzed: social media as a means of communication in the process of education and social media as a tool enabling students’ revision and testing of study materials. The first two studies, which were conducted in 2014 and 2019, are based on the same set of examined social media and fit the comparison, enabling to define the trend in students’ perceived satisfaction with social media for study purposes. The third and fourth studies discussed in this paper were run during the winter semesters of 2021 and 2022. Conclusions: The most significant differences between 2021 and 2022 can be seen in Instagram, Twitch, and other platforms, where a substantial drop in satisfaction in the communication field can be seen. The biggest difference in revision and testing is found in Facebook, Twitch, and Teams, which are abandoning online teaching and learning after the COVID-19 event. Social media use for studying has significantly decreased, with noteworthy decreases in Wiki, Facebook, and video calls. © 2023 by the authors.},

Following identification of the complex global crisis context, the first half of the chapter provides an overview of the three approaches-including complementarities arising from possible lacunae in each-as well as reviewing the major interests of their educational discourses; it then explores their joint contribution to education through the transversal lenses of philosophy of knowledge, andragogy/heutagogy, and normativity. The second half of the chapter potentializes the type of contribution such approaches can make to higher education theory and philosophy by advancing a yet deeper transversal engagement, one inspired by a complex interpretation of Boyer’s ‘scholarship of integration’; the engagement involves a matrix of: identity, relationality, and contextuality-in relation to: content of education, processes of education and systems of education. Calling upon such thinkers as Aurobindo, Buber, Gebser, Schumacher, Tarnas, and Davis, topics include: accountability, culture wars, currere, developmental levels, dialectics, ecological crisis, eco-logics, ethics, homo economicus, modern atomism, multiple intelligences, pertinence, planetary consciousness, poetics, postformal thinking, reconstructive postmodernism, schooling, systems thinking, transdisciplinarity, and worldviews. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Nicholas Hedlund and Sean Esbjörn-Hargens; individual chapters, the contributors.},

Quality in higher education seeks to achieve three goals-quality of design, quality of conformance and quality of performance. This paper brings together a number of higher education principles such as double loop learning, team teaching and heutagogy in order to satisfy these quality requirements. A pilot program was established to satisfy the changes to the Australian regulatory framework for tertiary education. The paper streamlines integrated ways to bring these aspects together that have not previously been identified in higher education publications. The specific focus is for an MBA course delivered in an Australian regional university. The result is a reflection of the application of the newly devised quality principled based heutagogical double loop learning cycle. The model can assist educational administrators and course developers to facilitate students in becoming independent lifelong self-motivated capable learners while at the same time ensuring the quality assurance principles are met. © 2018 by authors.

	abstract = {Education in its essential meaning should beget a civilized and socio-emotionally intelligent, competent mindset in its stakeholders. However, this seems an ideal situation which is impractical owing to several conditions and constraints that impede the implementation of holistic education. Pedagogical practices initially relied on rote learning and thereafter several reforms in educational policies asserted the importance of nurturing global competency among the learners. However, this shift from rote learning to a more self-directed learning is a challenging transformation which is idealized to a great extent. In this article, we argue that a sudden shift may not be possible, and to realize learner autonomy and their self-directedness, there should be a gradual but steady progress from pedagogy to andragogy and then to heutagogy. Self-directedness and learner-centredness are the crucial aspects of heutagogy. Taking examples from a case study that we conducted with teachers of English from select higher education institutions in India, we analysed the various tenets of heutagogy and its practicality in the Indian context. We investigated how teachers are incorporating aspects of heutagogy in their English classrooms and what major challenges are encountered. Their individual classroom episodes may serve as an initial reservoir of ideas to orient further research in the field. The possibility of embedding the PAH continuum in classrooms is analysed through the lens of socio-constructivist theory. The insights from this study will be valuable for teachers and students who wish to gain a deeper insight into the heutagogical learning paradigm and its integration into language teaching in the classroom. © 2024 The Kerala State Higher Education Council.},

The purpose of this study is to synthesize an empirical literature review of the M-Heutagogical practice among Higher Education students and its acceptance. The main objective of this paper is to review the literature on M-Heutagogy practice and its acceptance among Higher Education students. The researcher conducted a systematic review of 60 articles for the period 2007 to 2020. The findings indicate that M-Heutagogy has been applied in HEIs around the world with the support of emergent technologies and mobile applications. Unfortunately, only two M-Heutagogy acceptance studies have been done so far. Future research suggested that the M-Heutagogy acceptance model should be developed to be referred by researchers while doing an acceptance study. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {A variety of economic, social, political, and technological factors have come together to create a perfect storm of change in higher education: Skyrocketing educational costs, the demand for skill- and competency-based education, the rise of the knowledge economy. People are now lifelong learners, learning their profession throughout life, in chunks and when they need it. Added to that, the explosive advancement of technology in the last decade has made learning readily accessible at any time, everywhere, and in any form. The convergence of these factors has left higher education institutions scrambling and institutional, teacher, and learner roles in a state of flux. Heutagogy, also called self-determined learning, offers a teaching and learning framework for navigating the oncoming storm. The theory draws on established learning theories - humanism, constructivism, andragogy, transformative learning, and complexity theory - and the latest neuroscience to create a composite map for institutional leaders, teachers, and learners alike to apply to professional and lifelong learning. This chapter explores the tenets of heutagogy and how a heutagogical learning approach can be supported using the latest technological developments and be implemented in pedagogically meaningful ways in order to develop learners who are able to excel in today’s complex, global workforce. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

Furthermore, we explore the use of ChatGPT as a medical instructor in a medical classroom context. We seek to elucidate responses to a preset of questions in two categories separated based on targeted remediation, pedagogical knowledge, teacher ethics, query detail, practicality, and communication pattern. These responses are analyzed based on two rubrics designed on the basics of pedagogical prerequisites, and findings are reached with a thorough comparative analysis.

However, attempting to ‘get students to talk’ without acknowledging their diverse identities and needs can inadvertently reinforce oppression. Grounded in a heutagogical framework, this action research was conducted to address this limitation and advocate for diverse participation formats, such as inviting students to share relevant news, introduce innovative learning materials, or create social media content related to the subject field for broader audiences. Surveys with quantitative and qualitative measures, along with instructor journaling, were used to assess students’ perceived empowerment and to identify specific highlights and challenges from both students’ and the instructor’s perspectives. The results indicate that students find authentic ways to voice themselves through contributing to collective learning in formats aligning with their skills and comfort and perceive a stronger sense of empowerment afterwards. The findings contribute to the discourse on student voice implementation by highlighting the significance of varied participation formats in empowering students to develop adaptive leadership and boost engagement and agency in higher education. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.},

For example, in the future many routine tasks will be automated, resulting in workers having to undertake increasingly complex job roles, with teams in geographically dispersed areas (Barnes, S.-A. and Brown, A.

To allow employees to adapt to change, there is an increase in demand for skills that enable individuals to become flexible. Problem solving, communication, and digital skills are key to succeed in the new world of work, as they can be applied to multiple contexts (Bessen, J. (2015).

The learning design intends to improve learning ecosystems, bolster student engagement and afford learners and educators the benefit of choice and amplified autonomy. Second-year students at North-West University (South Africa) will be the first cohort to experience the application of the newly-designed basic literacy framework which informs the broader role-playing learning design exhibited here. The Web literacy framework put forward by Mozilla in 2018 to teach critical online proficiencies serves as the inspiration for the framework; informing the overall role-playing learning design at various levels. Depth of Knowledge indicators are mapped onto the Mozilla framework to deepen its applicability to tertiary education contexts. Elements of gamification, furthermore, are imbedded into the learning design to engage students with the self-directed learning aspects of the concept itself, i.e. to participate in authentic learning experiences as put forward by heutagogical instructional strategies. The role-playing learning design makes three roles available to learners, namely: Business Analyst (Read), Web Developer (Write) and Customer Service Representative (Engage). These roles are tied directly to the three basic literacy skill areas iterated upon in the basic literacy framework discussed here. Moreover, this article represents part one in a series of articles exploring the efficacy and potential of this approach to better serve our student cohorts and expand educational offerings.

	abstract = {The increasing shift from learning solely face-to-face towards various forms of online and blended or hybrid styles of educational interaction between faculty and students has been a feature of higher education over the past three decades. With improved internet access for individuals and small organisations, this shift has become even more pronounced and recognised as a major opportunity to provide a more equal geographical and social access to learning opportunities. The restrictions to travel and the gathering of large groups during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a major paradigm change for many institutions to adopt online course delivery. This has also necessitated a significant change in thinking about how online educational interaction is designed and delivered, and in many cases, the pedagogical change is running behind the changes in technology that facilitate improved distributed communications. The University of the Highlands and Islands in Scotland has been a significant early adopter of online education. This chapter attempts to summarise some of the key lessons learned in the design and implementation of learning and teaching strategies that encourage and support students to utilise online resources to enhance their own education. This chapter proposes a design structure and method of engagement based upon heutagogy (self-directed learning) that incorporates diverse digital learning resources to enable optimal flexibility for online learners. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Fei Victor Lim and Mercedes Querol-Julián; individual chapters, the contributors.},

We are in a constant state of flux and higher education needs to respond in more proactive, intentional and innovative ways to remain a relevant cornerstone to society and culture. The editors begin by asking how our collective reality might change if the complexity and uncertainty surrounding us were embraced and leveraged to serve the learner and society as a whole. They invite the reader to explore collaborative approaches to individualized learning pathways, networked learning and a reimagined ecosystem of academia. The chapters are arranged to inform the reader seeking knowledge on how to 1) reshape and redefine the 21st century university, with its evolving role in these transformative times; 2) design and implement courses that address the changing needs of the university and the non-traditional student; and 3) utilize research on innovative strategies with processes that promote organizational learning. The chapters profile the fluid nature of learning as it evolves in higher education and the workplace, often with a blurred line separating the two environments.

	abstract = {The last decade has seen technology entering the education space in multiple ways - through digitised learning content, adaptive online tests, pre-recorded or real-time videos of teachers, social networking, MOOCs, etc all that have been classified as Education 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. The predominant reference of these terms has been for higher education (college level and beyond). It assumes that the student is a mature and motivated adult who is able to take in discrete pieces of information and assimiliate it coherently to learn. This paper explores how Education 3.0 concepts are implemented in the realm of elementary education with a focus towards increasing students' learning outcomes. This paper combines our research in heutagogy by drawing on data from an intelligent tutoring system called Mindspark that has been used by over 80,000 students in 150 private schools over the past five years as well as in 5 afterschool remedial centres in urban slums of Delhi. There is a shift in educational processes - characterized by the transformation from a teacher-led delivery model to a student-led learning experience. In this Education 3.0 model, the learner is no longer a passive recipient but rather becomes an active player in defining their learning environment, the teacher-learner interaction, affective factors of learning, evaluation, interventions and finally achievement - all towards achieving higher outcomes on students' learning.},

	abstract = {For transformation to occur in learning environments and for learners, higher education must first consider how such transformation will occur for the designers and facilitators of learning experiences: the university teachers or educators we call faculty (in the US), instructors, lecturers or professors or, in some instances, university staff. For the purpose of this article, we will refer to them as educators or faculty, and the process of their professional development as educational development or faculty development (more historically common in the US context). We aspire towards universities in the future that cultivate connected, participatory educational development that crosses institutional and national boundaries, and which takes equity, social justice and power differences into consideration, promoting educator agency. We propose theoretical underpinnings of our approach, while also highlighting some examples of recent practice that inspire this direction, but which are small in scale, and can provide springboards for future approaches that may be applied on a wider scale and become more fully integrated, supported and rewarded in institutions. Our theoretical underpinnings are influenced by theories of heutagogy and self-determined learning, transformative learning, connectivist and connected learning, and an interest in equity. We share models of alternative approaches to educator development that take advantage of the latest advances in technology, such as #DigPINS, Virtually Connecting, collaborative annotation, and dual-pathway MOOCs. We then share a semi-fictional authoethnography of our (the authors’) daily connected lives, and we end by highlighting elements of the models we shared that we feel could be adapted by institutions to achieve educator professional development that is more transformative, participatory, and equitable. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Research in eLearning and technology enhanced learning (TEL) has predominantly focused on the creation of learning materials in appropriate forms, such as learning objects, the assessment methods that can usefully be applied online, and the delivery mechanisms for these materials, particularly in virtual learning environments (VLEs). In more recent times, research has begun to focus on pedagogical issues, and in particular whether there is some specific model that applies explicitly to online learning situations. Through a number of projects over the last ten years the authors have considered issues of learning style, learning strategy, pedagogy, immersive environments, student engagement and motivation, games-based learning, adaptation and personalisation. Emerging from this work, and from extensive consideration of the existing research in this area, this paper argues a need to move not only to a different pedagogic model, but also to change the existing structural approach to learning to support the rising demand for online distance learning provision worldwide. Fundamental to this argument is a need to support a heutagogic model of student learning, which requires that the students involved are sufficiently educationally mature to take control of their own learning experience. Whilst within traditional teaching models in higher education there is an explicit aspiration that students will emerge as educationally mature, metacognitive graduates, this is often seen as an outcome of the learning process itself, rather than as a skillset which can be taught and assessed. The paper describes an approach to metacognitive assessment that has already been used to determine the level and skills displayed by students in making selections of learning materials online. Based on this approach, a structural model for online learning support is proposed, using an assessment, feedback and training loop to ensure that students have the level of metacognitive skills necessary to take effective control of their own online learning experience.},

	abstract = {Open and Distance Learning (ODL) has a long history, one marked by the emergence of open universities, which was a critical development in the ecology of openness. Open universities have taken on significant local and global roles within the framework of meeting the needs of their respective regions of influence, and as such, their roles have evolved over time. Against this background, the purpose of this research is to explore the open university phenomenon by examining the case of Anadolu University in Turkey, a mega university that has transformed into what is now a giga university. More specifically, the research first looks at openness in education and how the concept itself has led to the emergence of open universities, before turning attention to Anadolu University, which is a dual-mode, state university with around 3 million enrolled students. Other issues that are addressed as part of this research include the rise of ODL and how it positioned itself within Turkish higher education; the historical development of Anadolu University and its massiveness, in terms of student numbers and services provided; local and global ODL practices; learner profiles, learning materials and spaces; exams and assessment and evaluation processes; learner support services, and Anadolu University's contribution, as an open university, to the field of ODL. The research shows that as an open university, Anadolu University has narrowed the information gap and digital divide, has enhanced equality of opportunity in education, and has provided lifelong learning opportunities. More importantly, as an institution that has gone beyond the conventional understanding of an open university, Anadolu University serves as a catalyst of change and innovation in its emergence as a role model for other higher education institutions. The following recommendations were able to be developed from the examinations of this study: (1) develop a definition of "openness" based on the changing paradigms of the 21st century and online learning, (2) enter into national and international collaborations between open universities, (3) adopt culturally relevant open pedagogies, (4) develop and design heutagogy-based curricula, and (5) unbundle ODL services in mega and giga universities. © 2019 Athabasca University.},

In recent decades, numerous different institutions have become the architectural framework for the promotion and implementation of sustainability in society, namely: governments, non-government organizations, universities, social enterprises, and the private sector. One of the key drivers of sustainability is social enterprise education. This driver has become vital in higher education, as it enables the learner to understand the complex processes of sustainability. This chapter critically explores the interlocking relationship of social enterprise and sustainability. The authors of this chapter present findings from their UKIERI research project entitled “The Benefits of Modifying Social Enterprise within Higher Education’s Social Sciences Curriculum.” Moreover, the authors argue that social enterprise can have a real influence in the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were set out by the United Nations in 2015. © 2022 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

As reflective blogs were found to be supportive of pre-service student teachers’ (PSTs’) as well as teacher educators’ (TEs’) professional development, the current study aimed to explore PSTs’ and TEs’ perceptions regarding the potential of integrating blogs into the BL modality. Applying a qualitative approach, analyses of 528 PSTs’ blog posts, transcriptions of two focus groups with 11 PSTs, and 3 TEs’ reflections and discussion transcripts yielded four themes that related to both the PSTs’ and the TEs’ perspectives regarding the integration of blogs into BL: (1) keeping sequential learning, (2) supporting self-directed learning, (3) keeping a sense of a learning community, and (4) increasing motivation and critical thinking. Nevertheless, both the PSTs and TEs described unique roles for blogging in BL. The TEs indicated that blogs support a sense of control, reveal misconceptions, and model teaching, while the PSTs indicated that blogs increase or decrease self-confidence during BL. The implications pertain to the contribution of blogging in BL, as well as to the four pedagogical principles of effective BL design: (a) continuity in learning, (b) fostering autonomous learning, (c) building a learning community, and (d) reflectivity and professional development. © 2025 by the authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes a synthesizing conceptual approach, built on developmental psychology, instructional science, expertise research as well as the pedagogy–andragogy discussion and the role of guidance in contemporary entrepreneurship education research. In addition, a new term, odigogy, is developed. Findings: Odigogy, from the Greek word odigós (to guide), addresses how to navigate student entrepreneurs in higher education. The term seeks to correspond both to the specifics of entrepreneurship as a subject and the characteristics of students in the classroom who are in a transitional phase between adolescence and adulthood. Practical implications: The paper contributes to current entrepreneurship education discussions by offering a more balanced terminology positioned between how to teach (pedagogy) and how adults learn (andragogy). The paper provides insights for teachers when developing teaching methods and learning activities in higher education. Originality/value: By introducing the term odigogy the paper seeks to contribute an enhanced understanding of the entrepreneurial learning process in higher education, which does not match pedagogical assumptions on how to teach children or adolescents, nor andragogical assumptions on how adults learn, or how to engage students in self-directed learning as presented in heutagogy. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Reducing this gap requires communicative literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which emphasize the use of technology, self-determined learning, and collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the participation of 124 Mexican students of technical-professional education. The study’s objective was to analyze how they scaled their communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico. Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic thinking (z = –2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly higher mean (M = 25.36) than men (M = 25.11). Qualitative results support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90%). This suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively enhance communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they can be spaces where both women and men achieve similar levels of digital literacy. © 2024 The Author(s).},

There is widespread consensus that due to this revolution in society, education needs to make a paradigm shift in order to stay relevant to the changing needs of society. Although this paradigm shift is promoted widely in academic literature, it seems as if in practice there are stumbling blocks preventing higher education to make positive strides into a new direction within the South African context. This research highlights some of the hurdles that Open Distance Learning higher education in South Africa is experiencing and also suggests a possible way forward to overcome these obstacles through the implementation of self-determined learning (heutagogy). In order for heutagogy to be implemented successfully, student support is of the upmost importance both in the curriculum design and the actual teaching and presenting of courses. © 2016.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to shed light on the mediating effect of heutagogical activities on the relationships between (1) social learning environment & self-determined learning and (2) students’ psychological needs & self-determined learning. The proposed model hypothesised that self-determined learning is dependent on the social learning environment, student psychological needs, and heutagogical activities. This study fills the knowledge gap by applying the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to test the proposed model based on a sample of 626 postgraduate students from a higher education institution in Malaysia. The findings revealed that heutagogical activities had mediating effect on postgraduates’ self-determined learning. These are new insights on self-determined learning as no studies have examined the mediating effect of heutagogical activities through structural equation modelling analysis. Overall, this study offers valuable contributions to the empirical evidence and body of literature on heutagogy by providing an extended understanding of the mediating role of heutagogical activities in postgraduates’ self-determined learning. The findings suggest that more efforts are needed to refine the learning activities in postgraduate education for the postgraduates’ development of self-determined learning. The theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research are also discussed. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream of society some twelve months ago has seriously challenged learning and teaching practice. Since then, AI companies such as OpenAI are constantly improving their language models and releasing new features to make them more capable and useful. So, given there have been many disruptors in the past and emerging disruptions in the present, what can we learn in this situation, where Generative AI stands poised to challenge the purpose and relevance of assessment models? From our examples, disruptive technologies only have a major impact when they positively transform practice and are informed by pedagogic models and learning theory. GenAI as a disruptor is only likely to have this positive impact when it informs quality learning and teaching practice. We should be focused on the opportunities that GenAI now presents to higher education. It is argued here and elsewhere that the relative weakness of GenAI is that it creates poor quality output, delivering uninformed, incorrect, biased and bland responses. In itself, this offers opportunities for ‘teachable moments’ (Newell et al, 2023) and gives us room to support students with their capabilities in an AI informed world. Historically, these opportunities enable higher education to grow and progress. What we have learned so far would appears to be that for research to contribute to the literature, they needed to be informed by it. Likewise, need to ensure that pedagogy, andragogy, and heutagogy come first. We also need to remember that people processes happen, artificial intelligence happens around them, and that artificial intelligence comes after human intelligence. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

Through a collaborative autoethnography, the authors, a graphic design educator and an instructional designer, reflect upon their conversations throughout a semester-long project involving the redesign of a design studio course to enhance design thinking with respect to graphic design. This chapter explores how their design pedagogies emerge and the disciplinary perspectives they bring to design pedagogy through an example of how self-analysis rubrics were developed and integrated as thinking scaffolds to support heutagogy or student-self-directed learning. The chapter discusses how design pedagogies are shaped and externalised through the collisions among designer identity, educator identity, and contextual demands such as curriculum, students, and societal trends. The implications for higher design pedagogies are discussed. © The Author(s) 2025. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The twenty-first century higher education sector has come a long way after undergoing continuous metamorphosis from pedagogy to andragogy. Most of the educational approaches adopted in medical schools are directed towards developing more of competencies and less of capability, which is the ability to use competencies in novel contexts. Competencies alone are not sufficient to thrive in the present day work place as medical profession subsumes complex contexts; it is in this scenario that, medical educators are entrusted with the challenging task of developing “capable learners”. In the heutagogical approach, learners are required to decide upon what to learn and how to learn and therefore the control of the learning process is on the learner and the role of the teacher becomes that of a navigator. This paper highlights the current higher educational practices based on heutagogy, considers its application in the context of Problem-based learning and also discusses a few challenges in incorporating this approach in the existing undergraduate medical curriculum. The article proposes the use of social media in order to support learner autonomy, which in turn improves learners’ cognitive engagement with content and tasks, thereby assisting the development of attributes associated with capability. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The process of teaching and learning at higher education institutions needs to be updated to meet the challenges of Industry 4.0. Different types of learning spaces and pedagogies, such as heutagogy, are required. Although heutagogy has been practised for a long time, there is a deficiency in studies which review the existing literature about implementing heutagogy. In light of this fact, this article is, therefore, a systematic review of the literature on the application of heutagogical methods in universities worldwide. This study utilized publications from 2016 to 2020 from databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, ACM Library, Science Direct, Emerald Insight, Taylors & Francis Online, as well as from the alternative database Google Scholar. The search efforts resulted in a total of 23 articles that can be systematically analyzed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). By using ATLAS. ti 8 as a tool, this review has five main themes, namely, i) ICT; ii) Blended Learning; iii) Outside Classroom Activities; iv) Distance Learning and; v) Module or Curriculum Related. The results showed that heutagogy is a suitable approach that can be applied in this era and that it is recommended that this approach be implemented during this COVID-19 season. Finally, at the end of this research, a number of recommendations for future scholars will be discussed.  © 2022 Little Lion Scientific.},

Around 320 million learners were prevented from going to schools/colleges across India causing a sudden joltin all educational activities. Despite the challenges, higher education institutions responded affirmatively and evolved to harness the advantages of assistive technologies to ensure the continuity of teaching–learning activities, research, and thus service to the society. The paper discusses the evolution of the blended learning paradigm and its efficacy to ensure higher learning specifically at the tertiary level. In the quest to identify a suitable instructional mechanism, academic institutions have pursued a variety of techniques including synchronous, asynchronous, or mixed-mode heutagogic learning approaches. The researchers seek to use a thematic literature review of the various relevant learning models to explain the nuances of blended learning attributed to the factors of commitment, flexibility, collaboration, and self-paced managed learning environments.

The collaboration was founded through establishing a like-minded community of practice built upon mutual trust, and the formation of a transdisciplinary design team. The STUDIO602 project demonstrated the mutual benefits of authentic collaboration between industry and higher education. Universities have expertise in supervising and mentoring student research teams to solve real-world problems. By building authentic collaboration between university research teams and hospital design teams innovative solutions to practical health care problems can be solved. Such collaborative design partnerships will lead to better health outcomes for society as innovative solutions to pre-hospital care, out-patient care, and innovative design of hospital infrastructure and technology-enhanced practices are developed. Extending these collaborations to international teams working remotely together we can widen the impact of the developments beyond New Zealand, and bring into the design team international expertise as well. We discuss the application of several techniques used in the software industry and how they relate to the STUDIO602 project—these include design thinking, team management, stakeholder engagement and rapid prototyping techniques. The innovation we are illustrating in this chapter through this project example are the development of pedagogical design principles to facilitate authentic collaboration between student design teams and industry. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.2022.},

This study included a convenience sample of 255 pre-service accounting teachers from a higher education institution in South Africa and a purposive sample of 18 students was drawn. Data collection was done through questionnaires and an interview schedule. A sequential explanatory design and sampling were employed. Data were analysed using SPSS for quantitative data and the interviews were transcribed and analysed qualitatively. The mean scores are above average (positive) for the cohort, however, there were numerous students with low scores in the effectance motivation and confidence scales. A more positive attitude towards effectance motivation in doing mathematics came from Indian, English and suburban respondents (p<.050). These students were not discouraged by difficult mathematical problems and are thus motivated by the challenges of mathematics. The interviews showed that parents positively influenced these students to persevere when faced with challenging mathematics problems. The results show no significant differences in the confidence in doing mathematics subscale (p >.050) in relation to gender, age, race group, mother tongue, Grade 12 mathematics, accounting module or location of schools. This finding runs counter to interview responses where 10 of the participants did not believe that they had a lot of self-confidence when it comes to mathematical accounting calculations and could not do advanced work without seeking help from others, compared with 6 participants who agreed that they had a lot of self-confidence when it comes to mathematical accounting calculations and could do advanced work without seeking help from others. In third-year accounting, strong significant connections were found between motivation in doing mathematics, confidence in doing mathematics and achievement in Accounting 420. © Creative Commons With Attribution (CC-BY)},

	abstract = {Purpose-After almost three centuries of employing western educational approaches, many African societies are still characterized by low western literacy rates, civil conflicts, and underdevelopment. It is obvious that these western educational paradigms, which are not indigenous to Africans, have done relatively little good for Africans. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to argue that the salvation for Africans hinges upon employing indigenous African educational paradigms which can be subsumed under the rubric of ubuntugogy, which the authors define as the art and science of teaching and learning undergirded by humanity toward others. Design/methodology/approach-Therefore, ubuntugogy transcends pedagogy (the art and science of teaching), andragogy (the art and science of helping adults learn), ergonagy (the art and science of helping people learn to work), and heutagogy (the study of self-determined learning). That many great African minds, realizing the debilitating effects of the western educational systems that have been forced upon Africans, have called for different approaches. Findings-One of the biggest challenges for studying and teaching about Africa in Africa at the higher education level, however, is the paucity of published material. Automated generation of metadata is one way of mining massive data sets to compensate for this shortcoming. Originality/value-Thus, the authors address the following major research question in this paper: What is automated generation of metadata and how can the technique be employed from an African-centered perspective? After addressing this question, conclusions and recommendations are offered. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Using two-sample and paired T-tests, results show that students under the experimental group, which applied the Feynman Technique, showed higher posttest scores and learning gains than those in the control group.

This is in line with the educational transformation towards achieving Higher Education 4.0 in Malaysia. Education 4.0 (Edu 4.0) is in line with the Industrial Revolution 4.0 (4IR) and underpin the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025. There has been a recent surge in published studies on Mobile-Heutagogy (M-Heutagogy), with most studies has been conducted in developed countries, where the outcomes of the studies have revealed that MHeutagogy has significant impacts on Edu. 4.0. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to discuss the M-Heutagogy pedagogical affordances of such a tool, the challenges that it poses, and the pedagogical change that is entailed for the adoption of the M-Heutagogy in the classroom. As a preliminary investigation in Malaysia, this study was carried out based on the phenomenological perspective of selected student teachers concerning the above affordances and challenges of MHeutagogy through interviews. It was revealed that the use of such a novel learning tool helped spur their students' interest, stimulate their curiosity, and improve their confidence in learning scientific concepts. In particular, the use of M-Huetagogy has proven can help to improve student participation in the learning process through more intense discussions among student teachers, which led to an improved understanding of learning concepts. However, the main barriers to full integration of such a tool in teaching and learning were attributed to the lack of technical support, teaching skills and confidence, and suitable facilities. © 2020 International Association of Online Engineering.},

It addresses how higher education institutions can leverage their embedded role within a community to foster social entrepreneurship, by leveraging adult learning theories of andragogy and heutagogy in (social) entrepreneurship education. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical study interviewed ten senior-level academics in the USA, the UK, Ireland and Australia with practical experience in the (social) entrepreneurship and social innovation space. Qualitative methods of structured interviews, coding and analysis were used as an appropriate procedure to examine the political ecology of U-BSEEs and the interconnectedness of its actors. Findings: Key findings included criticisms of higher educations’ role in society; financial resources and university impact on stakeholders; the potential of student-based initiatives and programs leveraging andragogy and ideally heutagogy adult learning theories; and changes universities could implement to become key actors of U-BSEEs. Student engagement and cross-disciplinary work is apparently the modus operandi to successful university based ecosystem development. Research limitations/implications: Research limitations included sample size and lack of junior and mid-level academic perspectives; surveys could be conducted in future research on the topic to generate quantitative data to strengthen findings. Implications of the research suggest that universities possess the necessary resources and personnel to serve as keystone actors of an ecosystem, but currently do not leverage the expertise available to them. Practical implications: All respondents concurred that focusing on students as change agents, and building social entrepreneurship education programs could foster a trophic cascade of increased collaboration, economic growth, political capital and social good in the local and regional ecosystem. Originality/value: This study is original in its attempt to build on the entrepreneurship ecosystem literature by considering the agency of U-BSEEs from a political ecology lens. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The results revealed that the most frequent instructional approaches included collaboration, self-regulation, personalization, and lifelong learning. Thus, instructional approaches encouraged students to connect with peers and instructors within the facilitative learning environment.

This enthusiasm is apparent more than ever before, as the current British Conservative governmenthas produced a white paper on the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF). The TEF intends to measure and improve the quality of teaching and learning within the higher education sector. With this proposed framework being introduced, universities will have to think of new ways of teaching and learning. This paper examines the pedagogical approach to self-determined learning within the dynamic of the tutor and the learner. In the paper, the authors argue for a fundamental rethink of how students learn in the higher education sector.

This article examines the lifecycle of various innovation programs in nursing education, including building, sustaining, and sunsetting of various recent initiatives developed in a college of nursing with robust innovation programming. Drawing on case studies such as the Master of Healthcare Innovation (MHI) program, the IDEA Workshop, and the Innovation Studio, the article explores how these programs were developed to meet specific gaps, strategies used to maintain their momentum, and sometimes challenges that led to their conclusion. The findings of our program review highlight the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, feedback-driven program development, and the need for tailored approaches based on the unique needs of each organization. Lessons learned demonstrate that while innovation frameworks offer valuable guidance, they cannot simply be replicated across institutions without adaptation. Successful programs were those that evolved to reflect diverse perspectives and maintained flexibility in addressing emerging challenges.

	abstract = {Our research question focuses on how industry-based practices enable learning experiences between a wide range of collaborators and in a variety of spatiotemporal surroundings, including educational contexts, supported by the latest technological evolutions. We start with the observation that the advent of the digital transformation of our society bridges the gap between industry and academia and provides many opportunities for the future by expanding learning experiences. This change has been undeniable since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, the success of apprenticeship training (Cerdin and Peretti in The success of apprenticeships, 2020; Montargot and Drillon in Succ Apprentice Views Stakeholders Train Learn 3:79–86, 2020) shows a growing interest in blended learning (Dziuban et al. in Int J Educ Technol High Educ 15:1–16, 2018) and ‘mixed processes and practices’ (Parsons and MacCallum in Agile and lean concepts for teaching and learning. Springer, 2019) on the part of companies and universities. Based upon three lecturers’ experiences in France, this chapter provides practical insights about how to align industry-based practices and higher education by focusing on three specific methods/approaches: ‘learning-by-doing’ through workshops, ‘project-based learning’ by means of case studies, and ‘heutagogy’ via mixed modes. Our aim is to highlight key challenges and barriers, advantages and opportunities of these three different approaches, and to suggest recommendations to support further development of innovative digital teaching and learning practices in higher education. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.2022.},

	abstract = {The growing importance of online learning in teacher education highlights the need to assess its impact on teacher professionalism. This study examines the effects of online learning within the in-service Teacher Professional Education (TPE) program at a State Islamic Higher Education institution in Indonesia. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research investigates online learning practices, curriculum adaptation, instructor preparation, and professionalism development. The quantitative analysis shows a significant, moderate correlation between online learning and teacher professionalism (R = 0.573), accounting for 32.9% of the variance (R² = 0.329), with a high statistical significance (p < 0.001). Qualitative results support these findings, emphasizing the role of relevant course materials, learning tool development, and instructor feedback in enhancing professionalism. Curriculum adaptation and thorough preparation by lecturers and mentor teachers are also identified as critical to the program's success. While challenges such as limited interaction and internet access persist, online learning has proven to improve teacher professionalism by offering greater accessibility and flexibility. This study concludes that online learning, when implemented with the right strategies, can significantly elevate teacher professionalism. The implications for Islamic education emphasize the potential of online platforms to strengthen teacher development and educational quality. © 2024, Faculty of Tarbiya and Teacher Training UIN Sunan Gunung.

	abstract = {This study was initiated to address the limited bibliometric analyses on heutagogy, despite its growing prominence in higher education as a learner-centered, self-determined approach. As the field gains momentum, understanding its research landscape is essential for guiding future pedagogical practices and scholarship. We conducted a bibliometric review of 290 publications from 2005 to 2024 indexed in the Scopus database, applying PRISMA guidelines and defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. VOSviewer was used to analyze citation networks, co-authorship patterns, and keyword co-occurrences. Findings show a significant increase in publications, peaking in 2020, with Blaschke identified as the most cited author and Cochrane as the most prolific. Auckland University led institutional contributions. The research spans disciplines such as education, computer science, and business, with thematic focuses on educational technology, lifelong learning, and 21st-century skills. However, collaboration remains largely regional, indicating opportunities for broader international engagement. The review highlights heutagogy's growing impact on flexible and technology-enhanced learning environments. These insights have practical implications for curriculum development, instructional design, and educational policy. Conclusively, heutagogy is poised to play a transformative role in higher education, particularly in promoting autonomy, adaptability, and lifelong learning. Future research should expand global collaboration heutagogical practices. © 2025 The Authors},

Thus, the evaluation of research productivity has become relevant due to the emerging development of the PAH continuum as a theoretical framework. This paper aims to explore the research productivity within the PAH continuum by performing a bibliometric performance analysis. An iterative search strategy was performed to identify PAH authors and then investigate their research productivity over a 5-year period (2017–2022) using the SciVal analytics instrument by Elsevier. Drawing upon the results from multiple bibliometric analyses, the study explores publication productivity specifically in relation to the PAH continuum. This study revealed that distance education, learning, teaching, professional development, and lifelong learning have been the most prominent research areas within the PAH continuum.

	abstract = {The approach that students take in their studies at university is critical not only for their academic success but is equally important in life-long learning for their career and professional development. Heutagogy is the study of self-determined learning and it is important that we appraise how students in higher education are developing their metacognitive awareness in how they learn and study effectively. Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary research area that involves the scientific study of the human mind. It helps provide new knowledge in relation to areas such as memory, problem solving, knowledge transfer and understanding of complex topics. Cognitive science has demonstrated that re-testing oneself on material when learning, enhances and promotes greater retention of knowledge compared to re-reading the material. Learning that is distributed or spaced out over multiple study sessions also allows for greater retention of knowledge in the longer-term compared to ‘cramming’ of information. To evaluate the use of effective study approaches and habits across three different levels of study in an undergraduate pharmacy programme, a survey study was employed. A paper-based survey was completed by first-, second- and third-year undergraduate pharmacy students (n=192) during class sessions. Although there was some evidence of metacognitive awareness such as using testing (retrieval practice) with practice problems; across all years, suboptimal study approaches such as rereading, copying notes and cramming were endorsed. A schedule of deadlines shaped the organisation of study and time management for most students. Self-testing was predominantly used to test learning rather than an approach used during learning. There was evidence of a difference between the cohorts in relation to decisions for prioritizing studying, returning to review course material and re-reading. The evidence from this study demonstrates that learners would require training on metacognitive awareness and effective study strategies to enable their self-determined learning capabilities to evolve. The linear progression through a programme of study alone will not achieve this. There is a need to embed and emphasize effective strategies for learning into curricula and for faculty to utilise metacognitive awareness in their teaching. Practitioner Notes 1. Self-determined learning places an expectation that learners self-regulate and take responsibility for their learning. Student’s independent study within a programme helps to consolidate learning. 2. Study habits and preferences vary among individuals however there is clear evidence from cognitive science that not all study approaches are effective. 3. Undergraduate students are using suboptimal study methods such as rereading notes, recopying notes and cramming information the night before a test. Self-testing was predominantly used to test learning rather than an approach used during learning. 4. Students report that they are not using approaches taught to them by teachers. It has been shown that learners incorrectly predict suboptimal methods as superior to evidence-based approaches. We suggest that evidence-based study approaches are explicitly emphasised and embedded within courses. 5. We recommend to senior managers with learning and teaching remits (Directors of Learning and Teaching, Pro Vice-Chancellors for Education and Student Experience) that faculty staff are informed about evidence-based learning approaches from cognitive science and increase metacognitive awareness in their teaching. © 2022, University of Wollongong.

	abstract = {Designing online learning activities that are both accessible to diverse learners and effective in fostering cognitive and social engagement poses significant challenges for educators in higher education. This paper addresses those challenges through a digital pedagogy lens by examining pedagogical theories and empirical studies on the design of learning activities. A systematic literature review was conducted using the Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES), and data were analysed using thematic analysis. The findings indicate that theories such as andragogy, heutagogy, cybergogy, socio-constructivism, and the Interactive, Constructive, Active, Passive (ICAP) framework can inform the design of online learning activities. The synthesis of the empirical literature on passive, active, constructive, and interactive learning activities reveals that they impact students' cognitive and social engagement in various ways, highlighting the importance of using different kinds of learning activities to ensure online learning is effective. Furthermore, the implication is that the most effective and practical design of online learning activities is one that involves learners, considers their internet and technological access, and reduces the responsibility of the teacher for designing those activities. The role of educators in online classes should be thus targeted at directing and guiding learners' cognitive, social and meaningful learning. © 2025 Society for Research and Knowledge Management.

Findings – Participating students indicate that peer assessment aided the achievement of an enterprise learning outcome relating to persuading and influencing. They also report developing skills that will be useful for the workplace, and identify additional learning benefits. Qualitative feedback suggests some discomfort with the inherent non-traditional instructor-learner relationship. Research limitations/implications – Acknowledging the limitations of using students’ own perceptions, the narrow focus on one course and the singular experience of summative peer assessment this investigation highlights the need for additional research into the impact of pedagogies where “teachers”deliver more of a facilitation role. Practical implications – The study reinforces the need for educators to invest time and effort in explaining the processes and issues involved with peer assessment. It highlights the contribution that creative industries’ educators might be able to make to the wider development of enterprise skills across higher education disciplines. Originality/value – The study contributes to two important but under-explored areas of educational research: the development of enterprise skills outside the business school and the use of peer assessment within enterprise education.

After conducting a systematic literature review using the terms heutagogy, blended and online learning, and lifelong learning, literature that considers how to inspire and build human agency capabilities over the lifespan was chosen for Delphi method expert review. Using this methodology, we explore the possibility that online and blended higher education will contribute, where heutagogical experiences exist, to technology-enabled lifelong learning. Results corroborate the idea that heutagogy and lifelong learning are intertwined by some common principles and that these are applicable to both blended and online learning settings and lifelong learning. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Recent, and what is often continuous, change is impacting all we do, including the design and delivery of education. This change requires new instructional models that improve immediate learning outcomes and prepares learners for learning across the lifespan. The use of instructional processes labeled heutagogy include the opportunity for, and application of, activities of learning self-direction, -determination, and -regulation, which can be helpful, even essential, for lifelong learning. What this paper adds This paper identifies an informed perspective, from data, that heutagogical design must be consciously implemented and supported for online and blended learning by instructional designers, instructors, and institutional leadership and infrastructure. It is reasonable to suggest that online and blended learning could contribute, where heutagogical learning opportunities exist, to technology-enabled lifelong learning. Instructional practices that include choice, flexible or negotiated assessment, facilitation of reflection, learner confidence development, and involvement of the learner in designing their learning can be considered heutagogical. Implications for practice and/or policy Develop policy in support of a change in instructional practice that embraces a heutagogical approach in the design of courses to foster greater self-directed and lifelong learning. Educational development to support instructors to understand heutagogy and how it can be applied in the design and delivery of blended and online learning to foster technology enabled lifelong learning. With the implementation of a heutagogical approach, student orientation along with purposeful scaffolding needs to be implemented to support students as they become more autonomous learners in technology-enabled settings. © 2021 British Educational Research Association},

	abstract = {Preparing students for the complex and changing nature of the workforce has become an overriding objective within higher education. New pedagogies, which incorporate both informal and formal learning and support personalization of learning, are central to this objective. Educators are required to reassess the use of traditional pedagogies, as they attempt to foster development of skills and competencies for lifelong learning. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is a learning theory that addresses this need, giving students agency in determining what and how they learn. The theory is based in the principles of learner agency, capability and self-efficacy, reflection and metacognition, and non-linear learning, and when used with technology can be a powerful instructional approach for building students’ self-directed and lifelong learning skills. A compelling example of this is the e-portfolio. As a platform and assessment tool, the e-portfolio spans the spectrum of lifelong learning, as well as encompasses both formal and informal learning of the individual learner and addresses critical aspects of learning and reflection, showcasing the learner’s acquired skills and competencies. Based on successful cases in the literature, this article discusses the principles of heutagogy, the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH continuum) and its application in online learning environments, and the use of the e-portfolio in further cultivating and advancing self-determined learning. The article also offers recommendations for future practice and theory. © 2020 Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the swift pivot to online learning, teachers and students have been forced to adopt a new way of teaching and learning, which has required students to become more self-directed in their learning. In addition, teachers are faced with the challenge of preparing students for the workforce and lifelong learning. One emerging approach for addressing both these challenges is that of heutagogy, or self-determined learning. This paper discusses the rising demand for lifelong learning skills and the role that heutagogy can play in supporting students in developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Specifically, the paper presents a case study of a higher education institution that has introduced heutagogy, using interviews with programme leaders/instructors to investigate how a college in Israel incorporated heutagogy into their master's education programmes. Case study results reveal that there are challenges in incorporating heutagogy (eg, difficulty for students in adopting the approach), but once adopted, students preferred learning in a self-determined way. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? Lifelong learning skills are critical to student employability, and there is a need for exploring new theories and approaches for developing these skills. The current pandemic has forced traditional learning into the online space, requiring more self-directed learning skills in learners. Heutagogy has been identified as a net-centric teaching and learning theory for online learning. What this paper adds Positions heutagogy for use in traditional and online classroom settings in order to develop learners' self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Explores the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum and its use as an instructional strategy. Presents a case study of a higher education institution that has implemented self-determined learning. Implications for practice and/or policy This study encourages further research into use of heutagogy for developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills. This study provides guidance for those who want to introduce self-determined learning into classroom settings. © 2021 British Educational Research Association.},

	abstract = {Nearly all educational institutions use learning management systems (LMS). Post-pandemic figures suggest that the uptake of LMS is about 98%. This means that most educators, especially those in post-schooling education, will use, and be responsible for designing, an online course site. While there is a tendency to use course sites as a repository and convenient communication medium, there is an unmet need to design these sites in a way that facilitates learning. As online teaching and learning become more prolific, especially in higher education and adult learning contexts, it is increasingly necessary to design course sites that facilitate learning as opposed to course sites that are just repositories. Just like the approaches that a teacher uses in classroom teaching, the teacher's underpinning philosophy will impact the way they will design their course sites on an LMS or website. Despite technology and online being present for over two decades, course design and teaching in the online environment remains trapped in traditional behaviorist and content-driven approaches. © 2023, IGI Global.

Our framework maps the SAMR educational technology adoption framework with three levels of creativity onto the Pedagogy-Andragogy-Heutagogy continuum. We illustrate the use of this framework in the context of three University courses: Communications Studies, Journalism, and Graphics Design. Critical to the framework is the establishment of collaborative communities of practice of lecturers and educational researchers who model the use of mobile social media in their own teaching practice. Implementing our framework has enabled a refocus upon ontological pedagogies rather than previous teacher-directed pedagogies. © 2014 IADIS.},

	abstract = {Purpose To date, didactic lecturing is a common method of university medical training. However, higher levels of competence to solve complex issues are hardly to be achieved with a largely passive learning style. We established and evaluated a heutagogical blended learning concept to investigate self-determined learning with a multimedia-based, interactive approach in the lecture room to teach clinical radiology. Materials and Methods In the 2019/2020 winter semester, we included 266 medical students in their fourth academic year in our prospective, observational study. Students participated in a series of 11 radiological lectures given by 10 lecturers. They were requested to prepare for lectures by watching learning videos. During the lecture, students had to answer key-feature questions (KFQ) in small groups and to jointly submit their answers by means of an audience response system (ARS). After each lecture and the exam, we conducted surveys and compared results with a historical control group. A focus group interview with lecturers was performed after conclusion of the lecture series. Results The students' overall impression of the flipped classroom concept and their examination grades were superior to historical controls (overall impression: 1.5 [95 % CI 1.4-1.6] vs. 2.7 [95 % CI 2.5-2.9] rated on a scale from 1 to 6, p < 0.001; examination grades: 1.8 [95 % CI 1.7-1.9] vs. 2.0 [95 % CI 1.9-2.0] rated on a scale from 1 to 5, p < 0.001). Most students agreed that learning videos (76.6 %), ARS (88.5 %), KFQ (76.5 %), and solution-oriented small group discussions (83.7 %) were useful. Lecturers stated an improved convergence of demands on learning and clinical competence. However, they also emphasized an increased initial effort for implementation. Conclusion Students rated the overall benefit from the heutagogical flipped classroom concept as high. Examination grades improved. According to lecturers, the flipped classroom concept better matched later professional demands than traditional lectures. Key Points: The benefit of the flipped classroom concept for radiological lectures was rated high by students. Most students were satisfied with the multimedia and interactive elements of lectures. Lecturers considered heutagogical learning demands as appropriate for later clinical requirements. Citation Format Teichgräber U, Ingwersen M, Mentzel H et al.

Many universities use Moodle for online teaching and learning. This paper explores the perceptions and experiences of students in three Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Mauritius. A mixed-methods approach was used, with an online survey questionnaire administered to 600 students and focus group discussions were conducted with 15 students from these institutions. It was found that 68.4% of respondents used WhatsApp compared to only 23.6% of them who used the e-learning platform, Moodle. There were no associations between the use or frequency of using WhatsApp or Facebook and the types of HEI to which the students belonged. Students preferred WhatsApp due to its facility for knowledge sharing and construction, its interactivity, its usability, respect for privacy and instant communication. From the findings, it is recommended that HEIs bring a shift in their approaches to teaching and learning from cognitivism to socio-constructivism, connectivism and heutagogy.

	abstract = {(1) Background: Although HIV has not diminished in importance in Canada, the field of HIV research remains small, and the graduate students who decide to pursue careers within it feel isolated and uncertain about their professional skills and opportunities. Universities Without Walls (UWW) was created in 2009 to help redress these shortcomings. This paper presents a case study of UWW, a non-credit training program for emerging HIV researchers in Canada. In particular, we focus on the possibilities of experiential learning via online and blended delivery. UWW uses both online and in-person teaching modalities to teach engaged scholarship, interdisciplinarity, community-based research (CBR), intervention research, and ethics. (2) Methods: Using a case study, we elucidated the research question: “What are the factors that make Universities Without Walls a viable training environment in the contemporary HIV/AIDS field?” Focus groups were conducted with 13 UWW key stakeholders in 2012 during a program mid-point evaluation; in 2014, telephone or in-person interviews with the three directors were conducted by a UWW fellow (the 4th author of this paper), and in 2019 the authors analyzed the information and anecdotal evidence, which had been incorporated as thick description. In addition, fellows’ self-assessments via portfolio and results from formal learning assessments were included. We also thematically analyzed 65 student self-reports (2009–2015). (3) Results and Discussion: Each UWW cohort lasted 9 months to one year and was comprised of: a) sustained mentorship from the co-directors (e.g., phone conversations, assistance with grant writing, letters of reference, etc.); b) fortnightly online webinars that aim to develop fellows’ knowledge of community-based research (CBR), research ethics, intervention research, and interdisciplinary research; c) community service learning in the form of a “field mentoring placement”; d) face-to-face engagement with fellows and mentors, most notably at the week-long culminating learning institute; e) a stipend for fellows to carry out their training activities. The UWW pedagogical framework features experiential learning, critical pedagogy, and heutagogy made manifest in the field mentoring placements (community service learning), mentorship mediated by technologies, and in-person learning institutes. Our analysis showed that experiential learning was imparted by UWW’s a) transparency about its “implicit curriculum”, the attitudes, values, character, and professional identity imparted in the program as well as the overarching programmatic elements, such as commitment to diversity, the inclusion of those with lived experience, the flexible admissions policies and procedures, interdisciplinary faculty, flexible team, administrative structure, and valuing of technology in conducting research, learning, and teaching; b) curriculum co-designing and co-teaching, and c) sustaining a community of practice. The main results reported in our case study included significant “soft outcomes” for UWW fellows, such as developing a “social presence” as a precursor to lasting professional connections; learning to experience community-based research, intersectionality, and interdisciplinarity by interacting online with persons living with HIV, leaders in the field, and a variety of stakeholders (including nonprofit staff and policymakers). (4) Limitations: While fellows’ self-evaluation data were collected by an independent assessor and anonymized to the extent this was possible, the co-authors inevitably bring their preconceptions and positive biases to UWW’s assessment. As UWW was developed to function outside of traditional academic structures, it is unlikely that the UWW program could be transferred to a post-secondary environment in its entirety. UWW was also built for the socio-political environment of HIV health research. (5) Conclusions: The experiences of those involved with UWW demonstrate that explicit curricular components—such as interdisciplinarity, community-based research, intervention research, and applied ethics—can be learned through a blended delivery when combined with opportunities to apply the knowledge in ways, such as a field mentoring placement and a learning institute. Related to this outcome, our case study describes that implicit curricular components in the formation of a professional—the sense of self in the field as a researcher, student, and community member—can also be delivered through a blended model. However, the tools and activities need to be tailored to each student for their context, while pushing their disciplinarian and professional boundaries. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {While teachers play an important role in education and supporting learning, many learners in under-resourced settings are not privileged to have access to teachers. Some of these underprivileged learners deal with the issue by engaging in self-determined and self-directed learning. Their efforts sometimes pay off with access to formal higher education and financial resources they would not access otherwise. This paper reports and discusses data from interviews with two secondary education graduates who hunted and learned on their own notes from the field of Math–Physique (Mathematics and Physics), took national exams as non-formal learners and won government sponsorship and student loans that are highly competitive in Rwanda. The informants subsequently completed their undergraduate education in Physics and Applied Mathematics, respectively. One of them was completing his master’s degree course in Applied Mathematics at the time of the interview. The data revealed decision-making, dedication and perseverance as key attributes of these learners. The informants adopted different strategies vis-à-vis challenges they encountered when they were learning on their own, and none of them surrendered. This study may benefit underprivileged learners as well as educators and institutions that are interested in opening up higher education in under-resourced settings. © 2016 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Teaching and learning in higher education is informed by a multitude of conditioning factors, not least the values systems and outlook of academics. Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by academics in relation to teaching and learning is therefore important if we are to make judgments about how we educate now, and could do so in the future. Developments in educational theory and digital technology have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in which students learn, and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses from universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has attracted interest from those who wish to see greater student control over the learning journey- but how widespread is this view amongst academics? This paper reports on a qualitative study in which 12 academics in an English Business School were asked to describe their views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate through the concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is little epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are going to innovate, then additional resource and professional development should be put in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in their epistemological positioning. The paper conceptualises academics’ positioning through a typology of epistemic views. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

	abstract = {Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) pedagogy refers to principles, methods, and practices used in teaching and learning vocational skills. TVET is focused on preparing individuals for the world of work by acquiring practical skills and knowledge. In recent years, pedagogical approaches toward flexible learning have been integrated. The teaching design in higher education nowadays enhances learning outcomes and prepares learners for the 21st-century workplace. Three pedagogical approaches were selected in designing the concept of TVET teaching strategy and integrated based on heutagogy, peeragogy, and cybergogy. Heutagogy encourages self-directed learning, while peeragogy fosters collaboration and learning from each other. Cybergogy uses digital technology to integrate TVET education, equipping students with knowledge, skills, and attitudes to thrive in the digital age and prepare them for future jobs. The concept of Heuta-Peera-Cyber was proposed after careful analysis of literature and past research. The result shows the principles of heutagogy can be linked with collaboration with peers and implementing technology to improve and develop learning experiences. In summary, by providing the resources for learning, the concept of teaching design can help to invent a more engaging, effective, and enjoyable learning experience. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Muhammad Mujtaba Asad, Prathamesh Padmakar Churi, Fahad Sherwani, and Razali Bin Hassan.

	abstract = {As the shift to distance learning was abrupt due to the COVID-19 pandemic, neither university students nor instructors were fully prepared. There was a real demand, therefore, for adopting principles that belong to Education 3.0 in higher education institutions as this pandemic might not be the last. This study aimed at evaluating to what extent the principles of Education 3.0 based on the heutagogical approach could be applied at universities. To achieve this target, a mixed approach was followed by utilizing two instruments; a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. A total of (200) students and (10) instructors from Birzeit University (BZU) were the participants. Data that emerged from the questionnaire were statistically analyzed, whereas the interviewees’ responses were qualitatively content-analyzed and grouped into main themes. The findings revealed that some principles of Education 3.0 have not been fully applied yet at BZU, such as supporting the learners’ self-determination; the individualization of teaching methods and strategies; blending synchronous online teaching mode with the face-to-face; empowering and coaching students to build personal learning environments with using multiple tools of authentic and real-life evaluations. Accordingly, it was recommended that universities worldwide as well as other higher education institutions should adopt the principles of Education 3.0 to make the shift to distance learning smooth for both students and instructors, especially by using flexible curricula and open learning resources; empowering students to determine their needs, objectives and personal learning environments; individualizing the teaching methods; and avoiding “One-size fits all” strategies. © 2023 Conscientia Beam.
