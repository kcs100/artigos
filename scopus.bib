	abstract = {This paper investigates how psychological needs spurring self-determined motivation relate to collective efficacy for flourishing in online learning communities. Self-determination theory posits individuals experience intrinsic motivation to flourish at educational tasks because of targeted satisfaction of the three psychological needs: autonomy, relatedness, and competence. However, studies conducted to investigate collective, technology-assisted learning processes suggest competence and relatedness may play a pivotal role in online community engagement and knowledge-sharing. Moreover, informal gaming experiences may mirror the collaborative skills needed in online educational/professional communities. These insights suggest confidence in one’s abilities to contribute to a community, the perception of a strong, supportive social culture in the online classroom, and informal online experiences may lead to self-determined motivation enabling agents in distributed, technology-assisted classrooms to collectively flourish. Little work has been done to examine effects of need satisfaction on collective efficacy in using online technologies. To fill this research gap, we used structural equation modelling to investigate perceptions of 636 undergraduate students enrolled in classes within an education department at a midwestern university employing weekly asynchronous blogging. Our results suggest students’ experience with multiplayer gaming, and need satisfaction towards competence and relatedness correlate with higher collective efficacy in technology-assisted classrooms employing discussion forums. Implications for practice or policy: • For instructors, student usership and design can spur motivation in online classrooms. • For researchers, understanding student perceptions of collaboration using technology can help understand how to design better technology-assisted classrooms. • The design of collaborative online educational communities should focus on creating positive social cultures and fostering competence for students © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

	abstract = {The integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the classroom for learning is becoming important to improve student engagement and interaction. This is in line with the educational transformation towards achieving Higher Education 4.0 in Malaysia. Education 4.0 (Edu 4.0) is in line with the Industrial Revolution 4.0 (4IR) and underpin the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025. There has been a recent surge in published studies on Mobile-Heutagogy (M-Heutagogy), with most studies has been conducted in developed countries, where the outcomes of the studies have revealed that MHeutagogy has significant impacts on Edu. 4.0. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to discuss the M-Heutagogy pedagogical affordances of such a tool, the challenges that it poses, and the pedagogical change that is entailed for the adoption of the M-Heutagogy in the classroom. As a preliminary investigation in Malaysia, this study was carried out based on the phenomenological perspective of selected student teachers concerning the above affordances and challenges of MHeutagogy through interviews. It was revealed that the use of such a novel learning tool helped spur their students' interest, stimulate their curiosity, and improve their confidence in learning scientific concepts. In particular, the use of M-Huetagogy has proven can help to improve student participation in the learning process through more intense discussions among student teachers, which led to an improved understanding of learning concepts. However, the main barriers to full integration of such a tool in teaching and learning were attributed to the lack of technical support, teaching skills and confidence, and suitable facilities. © 2020 International Association of Online Engineering.},

Facilitating professional development for lecturers to engage with innovation in teaching and learning utilizing new technologies is no simple process. However, we have found that structuring lecturer professional development around a sustained community of practice can result in a journey of conceptual and pedagogical transformation [1]. The increasing ubiquity of mobile devices and social media provides a platform for enabling pedagogical change. Thus we established a MOBile Community Of Practice (MOBCOP) of lecturers interested in researching the potential of mobile social media in education interested in exploring the concept of the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum [2], and how mobile learning can be utilized as a catalyst [3] to move towards student-directed heutagogy.

	abstract = {Students in higher education are using mobile devices, which challenges our understanding of what it means to learn in modern environments. By using mobile devices as instruc-tional aids, students gain a variety of social, cognitive, and technical abilities. Mobile devices may therefore be seen as supporting the growth of employability skills and broader lifelong learning, both of which may be helpful in a variety of circumstances. The quickly evolving landscape of technology and education presented teachers with a number of challenges, and they had to retrain and refresh their skills in order to provide practical training. As a result, heutagogical methods are ideal for enhancing their collective knowledge and skills. Online and blended learning (BL) offer a learning environment that incorporates technological affordances to facilitate learning. This enables the growth of an independent, capable, and self-directed lifelong learner. Heutagogy provides an educational strategy in this context that may link the development of lifelong learning competencies with BL and online learning environments. Using this methodology, we investigate the potential contribution of online and blended higher education to technology-enabled lifelong learning where heutagogical experiences are available. The results support the notion that heutagogy and lifelong learning are linked by some basic concepts that apply to both mixed and online learning environments. © 2024 by the authors of this article.},

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose This study of affordances in educational technology focuses on how the selfperceptions of teachers influence the creation of educational opportunities and how these are received by learners. Background It is important to explore the affordances offered by teachers, when using educational technology, from the perspective of their students. Within this topic, the interface of the educational technology affordances with the two agents—teachers and students—has often been neglected. Hence, the learning possibilities in educational interactions for the learners cannot be separated from the interactional possibilities created by teachers. The extent to which teachers can create opportunities to address their students’ needs, while effectively conveying the value of these opportunities to their students, is likely to impact on how well these affordances for learning and collaboration are utilised. Methodology A survey that includes two questionnaires was used. The questionnaires were circulated to 102 teachers and their 354 adult students in six higher education institutions in Oman. The questionnaires were analysed by SPSS Amos v20 for statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation. Contribution The study contributes to the field of e-learning because it demonstrates that the affordances offered by teachers for e-learning have an impact on the possibilities for students to engage. Both affordances were found to be highly correlated statistically. Further, teachers were found to primarily use the lowest level of engagement for online tasks, requiring low levels of cognitive challenge and social involvement from the learner. Findings The results indicate a low to medium level of self-directed learning that significantly correlates with perceptions of teaching possibilities for learning interactions. Recommendations for Practitioners Teachers are encouraged to vary approaches to student engagement in online teaching materials such as enhancement, additional engagement opportunities, and extension so that students are encouraged to use different cognitive abilities and capabilities to engage in social interactions. Impact on Society This study presents a strong recommendation with regards to extending the online affordances towards social interactions of learning beyond the boundary of the classroom. Future Research Further studies on e-heutagogy and affordances of both teachers and students are needed. The effect of teachers created opportunities on students learning actions is an area that grants further investigation. © This article is licensed to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.

	abstract = {Our research question focuses on how industry-based practices enable learning experiences between a wide range of collaborators and in a variety of spatiotemporal surroundings, including educational contexts, supported by the latest technological evolutions. We start with the observation that the advent of the digital transformation of our society bridges the gap between industry and academia and provides many opportunities for the future by expanding learning experiences. This change has been undeniable since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, the success of apprenticeship training (Cerdin and Peretti in The success of apprenticeships, 2020; Montargot and Drillon in Succ Apprentice Views Stakeholders Train Learn 3:79–86, 2020) shows a growing interest in blended learning (Dziuban et al. in Int J Educ Technol High Educ 15:1–16, 2018) and ‘mixed processes and practices’ (Parsons and MacCallum in Agile and lean concepts for teaching and learning. Springer, 2019) on the part of companies and universities. Based upon three lecturers’ experiences in France, this chapter provides practical insights about how to align industry-based practices and higher education by focusing on three specific methods/approaches: ‘learning-by-doing’ through workshops, ‘project-based learning’ by means of case studies, and ‘heutagogy’ via mixed modes. Our aim is to highlight key challenges and barriers, advantages and opportunities of these three different approaches, and to suggest recommendations to support further development of innovative digital teaching and learning practices in higher education. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.2022.},

	abstract = {A variety of economic, social, political, and technological factors have come together to create a perfect storm of change in higher education: Skyrocketing educational costs, the demand for skill- and competency-based education, the rise of the knowledge economy. People are now lifelong learners, learning their profession throughout life, in chunks and when they need it. Added to that, the explosive advancement of technology in the last decade has made learning readily accessible at any time, everywhere, and in any form. The convergence of these factors has left higher education institutions scrambling and institutional, teacher, and learner roles in a state of flux. Heutagogy, also called self-determined learning, offers a teaching and learning framework for navigating the oncoming storm. The theory draws on established learning theories - humanism, constructivism, andragogy, transformative learning, and complexity theory - and the latest neuroscience to create a composite map for institutional leaders, teachers, and learners alike to apply to professional and lifelong learning. This chapter explores the tenets of heutagogy and how a heutagogical learning approach can be supported using the latest technological developments and be implemented in pedagogically meaningful ways in order to develop learners who are able to excel in today’s complex, global workforce. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	abstract = {This study was initiated to address the limited bibliometric analyses on heutagogy, despite its growing prominence in higher education as a learner-centered, self-determined approach. As the field gains momentum, understanding its research landscape is essential for guiding future pedagogical practices and scholarship. We conducted a bibliometric review of 290 publications from 2005 to 2024 indexed in the Scopus database, applying PRISMA guidelines and defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. VOSviewer was used to analyze citation networks, co-authorship patterns, and keyword co-occurrences. Findings show a significant increase in publications, peaking in 2020, with Blaschke identified as the most cited author and Cochrane as the most prolific. Auckland University led institutional contributions. The research spans disciplines such as education, computer science, and business, with thematic focuses on educational technology, lifelong learning, and 21st-century skills. However, collaboration remains largely regional, indicating opportunities for broader international engagement. The review highlights heutagogy's growing impact on flexible and technology-enhanced learning environments. These insights have practical implications for curriculum development, instructional design, and educational policy. Conclusively, heutagogy is poised to play a transformative role in higher education, particularly in promoting autonomy, adaptability, and lifelong learning. Future research should expand global collaboration heutagogical practices. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {This theoretical article presents the foundational aspects of a conceptual, role-playing learning design intended for use in Higher Education Schools of computer science and information technology. The learning design intends to improve learning ecosystems, bolster student engagement and afford learners and educators the benefit of choice and amplified autonomy. Second-year students at North-West University (South Africa) will be the first cohort to experience the application of the newly-designed basic literacy framework which informs the broader role-playing learning design exhibited here. The Web literacy framework put forward by Mozilla in 2018 to teach critical online proficiencies serves as the inspiration for the framework; informing the overall role-playing learning design at various levels. Depth of Knowledge indicators are mapped onto the Mozilla framework to deepen its applicability to tertiary education contexts. Elements of gamification, furthermore, are imbedded into the learning design to engage students with the self-directed learning aspects of the concept itself, i.e. to participate in authentic learning experiences as put forward by heutagogical instructional strategies. The role-playing learning design makes three roles available to learners, namely: Business Analyst (Read), Web Developer (Write) and Customer Service Representative (Engage). These roles are tied directly to the three basic literacy skill areas iterated upon in the basic literacy framework discussed here. Moreover, this article represents part one in a series of articles exploring the efficacy and potential of this approach to better serve our student cohorts and expand educational offerings.

	abstract = {The increasing shift from learning solely face-to-face towards various forms of online and blended or hybrid styles of educational interaction between faculty and students has been a feature of higher education over the past three decades. With improved internet access for individuals and small organisations, this shift has become even more pronounced and recognised as a major opportunity to provide a more equal geographical and social access to learning opportunities. The restrictions to travel and the gathering of large groups during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a major paradigm change for many institutions to adopt online course delivery. This has also necessitated a significant change in thinking about how online educational interaction is designed and delivered, and in many cases, the pedagogical change is running behind the changes in technology that facilitate improved distributed communications. The University of the Highlands and Islands in Scotland has been a significant early adopter of online education. This chapter attempts to summarise some of the key lessons learned in the design and implementation of learning and teaching strategies that encourage and support students to utilise online resources to enhance their own education. This chapter proposes a design structure and method of engagement based upon heutagogy (self-directed learning) that incorporates diverse digital learning resources to enable optimal flexibility for online learners. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Fei Victor Lim and Mercedes Querol-Julián; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {The last decade has seen technology entering the education space in multiple ways - through digitised learning content, adaptive online tests, pre-recorded or real-time videos of teachers, social networking, MOOCs, etc all that have been classified as Education 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. The predominant reference of these terms has been for higher education (college level and beyond). It assumes that the student is a mature and motivated adult who is able to take in discrete pieces of information and assimiliate it coherently to learn. This paper explores how Education 3.0 concepts are implemented in the realm of elementary education with a focus towards increasing students' learning outcomes. This paper combines our research in heutagogy by drawing on data from an intelligent tutoring system called Mindspark that has been used by over 80,000 students in 150 private schools over the past five years as well as in 5 afterschool remedial centres in urban slums of Delhi. There is a shift in educational processes - characterized by the transformation from a teacher-led delivery model to a student-led learning experience. In this Education 3.0 model, the learner is no longer a passive recipient but rather becomes an active player in defining their learning environment, the teacher-learner interaction, affective factors of learning, evaluation, interventions and finally achievement - all towards achieving higher outcomes on students' learning.},

	abstract = {Can a new instructional approach influence lifelong learning and the development of competent lifelong learners? Blended and online learning provides a platform for learning that introduces technological affordance to enable learning. We seek to find an intersection between blended and online learning and lifelong learning through an instructional approach that encourages learners towards management of their own learning. This opens the door to becoming an autonomous, capable, self-directed lifelong learner. In this context, heutagogy offers an instructional approach that may connect blended and online learning settings with the development of lifelong learning competence. After conducting a systematic literature review using the terms heutagogy, blended and online learning, and lifelong learning, literature that considers how to inspire and build human agency capabilities over the lifespan was chosen for Delphi method expert review. Using this methodology, we explore the possibility that online and blended higher education will contribute, where heutagogical experiences exist, to technology-enabled lifelong learning. Results corroborate the idea that heutagogy and lifelong learning are intertwined by some common principles and that these are applicable to both blended and online learning settings and lifelong learning. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Recent, and what is often continuous, change is impacting all we do, including the design and delivery of education. This change requires new instructional models that improve immediate learning outcomes and prepares learners for learning across the lifespan. The use of instructional processes labeled heutagogy include the opportunity for, and application of, activities of learning self-direction, -determination, and -regulation, which can be helpful, even essential, for lifelong learning. What this paper adds This paper identifies an informed perspective, from data, that heutagogical design must be consciously implemented and supported for online and blended learning by instructional designers, instructors, and institutional leadership and infrastructure. It is reasonable to suggest that online and blended learning could contribute, where heutagogical learning opportunities exist, to technology-enabled lifelong learning. Instructional practices that include choice, flexible or negotiated assessment, facilitation of reflection, learner confidence development, and involvement of the learner in designing their learning can be considered heutagogical. Implications for practice and/or policy Develop policy in support of a change in instructional practice that embraces a heutagogical approach in the design of courses to foster greater self-directed and lifelong learning. Educational development to support instructors to understand heutagogy and how it can be applied in the design and delivery of blended and online learning to foster technology enabled lifelong learning. With the implementation of a heutagogical approach, student orientation along with purposeful scaffolding needs to be implemented to support students as they become more autonomous learners in technology-enabled settings. © 2021 British Educational Research Association},

For the purpose of this article, we will refer to them as educators or faculty, and the process of their professional development as educational development or faculty development (more historically common in the US context). We aspire towards universities in the future that cultivate connected, participatory educational development that crosses institutional and national boundaries, and which takes equity, social justice and power differences into consideration, promoting educator agency. We propose theoretical underpinnings of our approach, while also highlighting some examples of recent practice that inspire this direction, but which are small in scale, and can provide springboards for future approaches that may be applied on a wider scale and become more fully integrated, supported and rewarded in institutions. Our theoretical underpinnings are influenced by theories of heutagogy and self-determined learning, transformative learning, connectivist and connected learning, and an interest in equity. We share models of alternative approaches to educator development that take advantage of the latest advances in technology, such as #DigPINS, Virtually Connecting, collaborative annotation, and dual-pathway MOOCs. We then share a semi-fictional authoethnography of our (the authors’) daily connected lives, and we end by highlighting elements of the models we shared that we feel could be adapted by institutions to achieve educator professional development that is more transformative, participatory, and equitable. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {A new era of student-centered learning, fueled by the power of digital tools and advanced teaching methods, means that classrooms are no longer entirely defined by four walls and a teacher at the leadership. At the same time, the educational landscape of African countries is very slowly adapting to these changes: the traditional face-to-face approach to learning dominates, student groups are overcrowded, and there is a significant gap in digital skills between students from urban and rural areas. Today, the development of online education becomes an important prerequisite for addressing the problem of educational disparity, a tool for meeting individual educational needs, increasing students' motivation and responsibility for their learning outcomes. The Self-Determined Learning Approach allows for a personalized learning environment in which students can choose what, how and when they learn, work at their pace, choose or receive learning tasks in an order that makes sense to them, which allows for the individual interests of each student, learning style, cultural identity, life experience and personal challenges. The research is based on the results of in-depth interviews with students aged between 25 and 37 years with work (2‒5 years) and study experience, who fit the profile of self-determined learners, have part-time distance learning experience, are employed in different positions and are currently studying different programs, and are also registered with one of the three Distance Education Institutions. All participants are in their final year of study and have experienced digital transformation in distance education. This qualitative study is based on a constructivist paradigm employing a phenomenological strategy to explain the perceptions of students regarding how self-determined practices are applied at their institutions. The phenomenological approach aimed to capture the lived experiences of these students, focusing on their descriptions and interpretations of encountering self-determination practices in their educational environment. The results of the study confirmed the value of a self-determined approach to learning and its positive impact on enhancing students' workplace adaptability. However, at the same time, the survey revealed that African higher education institutions are not ready for the effective implementation of self-determined learning technologies, the main reasons being the lack of technology and the unpreparedness of teachers. © 2024 by the author.},

	abstract = {Preparing students for the complex and changing nature of the workforce has become an overriding objective within higher education. New pedagogies, which incorporate both informal and formal learning and support personalization of learning, are central to this objective. Educators are required to reassess the use of traditional pedagogies, as they attempt to foster development of skills and competencies for lifelong learning. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is a learning theory that addresses this need, giving students agency in determining what and how they learn. The theory is based in the principles of learner agency, capability and self-efficacy, reflection and metacognition, and non-linear learning, and when used with technology can be a powerful instructional approach for building students’ self-directed and lifelong learning skills. A compelling example of this is the e-portfolio. As a platform and assessment tool, the e-portfolio spans the spectrum of lifelong learning, as well as encompasses both formal and informal learning of the individual learner and addresses critical aspects of learning and reflection, showcasing the learner’s acquired skills and competencies. Based on successful cases in the literature, this article discusses the principles of heutagogy, the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH continuum) and its application in online learning environments, and the use of the e-portfolio in further cultivating and advancing self-determined learning.

Reducing this gap requires communicative literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which emphasize the use of technology, self-determined learning, and collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the participation of 124 Mexican students of technical-professional education. The study’s objective was to analyze how they scaled their communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico. Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic thinking (z = –2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly higher mean (M = 25.36) than men (M = 25.11). Qualitative results support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90%). This suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively enhance communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they can be spaces where both women and men achieve similar levels of digital literacy. © 2024 The Author(s).},

This means that most educators, especially those in post-schooling education, will use, and be responsible for designing, an online course site. While there is a tendency to use course sites as a repository and convenient communication medium, there is an unmet need to design these sites in a way that facilitates learning. As online teaching and learning become more prolific, especially in higher education and adult learning contexts, it is increasingly necessary to design course sites that facilitate learning as opposed to course sites that are just repositories. Just like the approaches that a teacher uses in classroom teaching, the teacher's underpinning philosophy will impact the way they will design their course sites on an LMS or website. Despite technology and online being present for over two decades, course design and teaching in the online environment remains trapped in traditional behaviorist and content-driven approaches. © 2023, IGI Global.

	abstract = {Tailored professional development (PD) programmes assist university teaching staff to capitalise on the educational use of technology. To supplement on-campus PD support, staff at Avondale College of Higher Education developed a self-help online resource, Moodle's Little Helper (MLH), that has since become an integral and accepted component of the institution's PD landscape. Since Avondale's overall PD program is built upon the theoretical underpinnings of heutagogy (Hase, 2009; Hase & Kenyon, 2003), a self-determined learning theory, the purpose and nature of the resource also reflects the key principles of this educational philosophy. Adopting a utilisation-focused research methodology (Patton, 2011) ensured staff needs were identified and met within MLH's customised content, homegrown style and iterative development. The outcomes from the first stages of the study provide commentary on how the theoretical principles of heutagogy can be employed to gain greater reach and efficiency when PD support is in high demand.},

	abstract = {Background: Simulation-based Learning (SBL) was used in Machining Technology, a sixtyhour module for second year engineering students, at the School of Engineering at Temasek Polytechnic. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of SBL on learners' motivation and performance. In assessing students' motivation, we adopted a framework based on the Self-determination Theory (SDT), chosen on account of its comprehensive treatment of the relationship between students' perceived needs satisfaction and their motivation. Purpose: (HYPOTHESIS) It is hypothesized that SBL, which provides learners with interactive learning experiences, will enhance students' motivation and performance. We explored the effect of SBL on students' perceived psychological needs satisfaction, motivation, and learning, and how SBL affected students' understanding and application of content knowledge. DESIGN/METHOD: The intervention procedure involved the incorporation of SBL in Machining Technology, a 60 hour module in the mechanical engineering program. Survey findings and post-intervention assessment outcomes were used to assess the students' perceptions of their basic psychological needs satisfaction, motivation, and performance. Results: Our findings suggest that the students perceived their psychological needs to be satisfied and had high levels of self-determined motivation. Students who undertook SBL had higher mean performance test scores, although SBL may have differential effects on learners depending on factors such as gender, educational backgrounds, and IT knowledge. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the students perceived their basic psychological needs to be met and that SBL can potentially enhance self-determined motivation as well as improve learning in general.},

	abstract = {Learning continuity in the realm of Education 4.0 is posing a stiff challenge to educators due to the physical restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic on institutional learning. Around 320 million learners were prevented from going to schools/colleges across India causing a sudden joltin all educational activities. Despite the challenges, higher education institutions responded affirmatively and evolved to harness the advantages of assistive technologies to ensure the continuity of teaching–learning activities, research, and thus service to the society. The paper discusses the evolution of the blended learning paradigm and its efficacy to ensure higher learning specifically at the tertiary level. In the quest to identify a suitable instructional mechanism, academic institutions have pursued a variety of techniques including synchronous, asynchronous, or mixed-mode heutagogic learning approaches. The researchers seek to use a thematic literature review of the various relevant learning models to explain the nuances of blended learning attributed to the factors of commitment, flexibility, collaboration, and self-paced managed learning environments. The paper proposes a narrative of andragogic styles that are universal and acceptable for higher education institutions to practice and avoid disruption to education. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Teaching and learning in higher education is informed by a multitude of conditioning factors, not least the values systems and outlook of academics. Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by academics in relation to teaching and learning is therefore important if we are to make judgments about how we educate now, and could do so in the future. Developments in educational theory and digital technology have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in which students learn, and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses from universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has attracted interest from those who wish to see greater student control over the learning journey- but how widespread is this view amongst academics? This paper reports on a qualitative study in which 12 academics in an English Business School were asked to describe their views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate through the concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is little epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are going to innovate, then additional resource and professional development should be put in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in their epistemological positioning. The paper conceptualises academics’ positioning through a typology of epistemic views. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},
