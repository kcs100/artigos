	abstract = {The benefits of physical activity in the school setting are widely proven; however, factors such as student motivation and equality perceptions are determinants of participation and learning opportunities in Physical Education. The aim of the present research was to analyse existing relationships between physical activity, motivation and perceptions of equality and discrimination in Physical Education as a function of sex, as well as to identify the extent to which motivation and equality affect physical activity engagement in secondary education students. The sample was made up of 310 students (13.9 ± 1.2 years) with the PAQ-C, the motivation in Physical Education questionnaire and the questionnaire of perception of equality and discrimination in Physical Education being administered for data collection. Data were analysed according to Mann-Whitney U, Spearman correlation and linear regression outcomes. Main outcomes demonstrate statistically significant sex differences in physical activity engagement and perceptions of equality and discrimination. In turn, physical activity engagement was observed to be positively associated with intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (identified, introjected and external regulation). Further, perceived equality was related with self-determined forms of motivation, whilst perceived discrimination was related with less self-determined forms of motivation. Finally, regression outcomes revealed that identified regulation positively and significantly predicts physical activity engagement, whilst perceived equality was inversely related with this variable. In conclusion, males present higher levels of physical activity engagement, lower perceptions of equality and higher perceptions of discrimination. Furthermore, more self-determined levels of motivation contribute towards higher levels of physical activity engagement in the context of Physical Education. © 2025, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

	abstract = {Effective physical activity (PA) programs may enhance students’ awareness, competence, and motivation to participate in PA in the future for their health and mental well-being. The most effective way to accomplish this is through in-school and after-school activities. However, certain obstacles (traditional ways) may prevent some students from gaining these benefits. By eliminating these and other barriers, transforming after-school PA programs into in-school PA programs can enhance access to PA services. Despite this, the change in learning context from after-school to in-school may affect student engagement and program effectiveness by altering the interaction between students and teachers. Self-determination theory was employed to explain how the learning context affects motivation and social outcomes in PA programs for primary school students. The study involved 513 students from 12 different schools in Shanxi Province, China, in 2022. They represented 46.24% girls and 53.76% boys, ranging in age from 9 to 12. Teachers conducted PA programs to motivate students to participate in healthy activities. Assessment of student–teacher interactions, psychological needs satisfaction, and motivation was conducted among PA students through questionnaires. Relationships between students and teachers were incorporated into a structural equation model as direct and mediated determinants of motivation for attendance PA programs. There is agreement between the results and the hypothesized model, which predicts higher levels of psychological need satisfaction and higher levels of intrinsic motivation. In addition, the learning context only negatively affects less-self-determined motivations. Results confirm that positive perceptions of teachers by students play a significant role in promoting incentives for PA program participation in more self-determined manners. Furthermore, innovative strategies to reduce the detrimental effects of long-standing institutional structures and procedures should be considered and incorporated into in-school programs that motivate students to participate in these programs. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The needs of today’s higher education have changed and higher education does not need a one-way communication from teacher to student but rather learn to appreciate the new role of the teacher as a facilitator with mutual responsibilities toward the creation of knowledge. Heutagogy, which emphasizes learner autonomy and the creation of self-determined learners, has garnered attention as a potential solution to address the evolving needs of teacher preparation. However, empirical research on the beliefs and attitudes of Heutagogy within the teacher education context remains limited. This study aimed to fill this gap by exploring the beliefs and attitudes of lecturers and pre-service teachers of the School of Education and Life-Long Learning (SoELL) at SDD-UBIDS. Methods: Convergent mixed method design with both quantitative and qualitative data analysis, the study collected both quantitative and qualitative data on 513 Pre-service teachers and 30 Lecturers from SoELL, SDD-UBIDS using a four-point Likert scale questionnaire and interview. Results: The findings revealed diverse perspectives among Lecturers and Pre-service Teachers regarding Heutagogy, with varying levels of understanding, acceptance, and readiness for implementation. Lecturers expressed enthusiasm for Heutagogy’s potential to foster learner autonomy and critical thinking skills, while pre-service teachers demonstrated varying levels of readiness and comfort with self-directed learning approaches. Discussion: Lecturers and Pre-service teachers expressed willingness to embrace a self-determined approach in which the learner reflects on what is learned and how it is learned and where the Lecturers teach the learners how to learn by themselves. The cognitive conflict and the inadequacy of pre-service teachers’ preparedness will necessitate a shift in their attitudes toward developing autonomy skills to effectively navigate the challenges of the 21st-century knowledge economy.

	abstract = {This book explores heutagogy (self-determined learning) - a new approach to teaching and learning in higher education - and proposes a paradigm shift in teaching, learning, and the educational enterprise and ecosystem. The first part of the book presents the philosophical, psychological and sociological foundations of heutagogy, and describes lessons learned from prior experiences of its implementation. The second part presents a collaborative self-study of five heutagogy courses in higher education. The third discusses how the academic community can enhance the paradigm change, and compares heutagogy to similar academic approaches. The concluding chapter of the book explores the question of "what next"? and suggests some possible elaborations of heutagogy. "At the beginning, it was very difficult for me to appreciate the course's mode of learning. All my life I had learned in a traditional manner. Occasionally I felt that I was being thrown into deep water without a lifeguard. ... But as the course progressed, I succeeded in letting go of my deeply rooted habits and discovered a new learning approach, through which I found in myself a new learner..." (Student's reflection) "...this book suggests a novel approach to learning and education and will become a widely read one."

	abstract = {Background: Guided self-study (G-SS) can be used as a self-directed learning method or self-determined learning that fosters changes in knowledge and skills in a higher physiotherapy education setting. Until now, there has been no empirical evidence for the use of G-SS in higher physiotherapy education. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility to establish a G-SS program in a fulltime undergraduate physiotherapy degree course. In addition, the effectiveness of the G-SS was assessed on changes in knowledge and skills. Method: Fifty-one first-semester physiotherapy students were randomly divided into a G-SS group or control group (CG). The G-SS group received six clinical cases. Each case was processed in an eight-day cycle. One week in advance, the clinical case were provided to the students electronically (day 1). The students prepared the cases in groups and were guided by the tutor during this preparation time (day 2 to 7). Group work results were presented and reflected on during a moderated plenum session at day 8. A priori criteria of success were defined based on empirical experience for the primary outcome parameters i) exposure, ii) responsiveness of students and iii) program differentiation. The secondary outcome was the total score in the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) and written exams. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS. Results: The responsiveness of students as willing to participate in the G-SS program was 23%, clearly below the a priori set 83%. No differences in program differentiation were found. G-SS as compared to the CG scored significantly better on OSCE (p = 0.003) and on the written exam (p = 0.004). Conclusion: The results showed that this higher education G-SS program in its current form was not feasible. Slight modification of the study protocol (e.g. better time planning in the academic calendar) is needed to improve the student’s responsiveness. The adjustments to the timetable must allow the physiotherapy students to prepare the clinical cases under conditions of lower workload. G-SS has the potential to promote change in knowledge and skills in undergraduate physiotherapy students when students prepare and present the clinical case solutions and reflect upon their actions.

	abstract = {An increasing number of neurodivergent learners attend higher education. This necessitates examination of best-fit learning models to successfully support the current generation of college students. While pedagogy and andragogy have historical relevance, in isolation, they may lack alignment with the individualization embedded in neurodiversity-affirming practice. This study conceptualized a novel learning framework for neurodivergent college students through the lens of neurodiversity-affirming practice. Via constant comparative qualitative analysis of American university faculty interviews and framework juxtaposition, three themes were identified: pedagogy vs. andragogy, self-determination, and interdependency. Thematic analysis revealed uncertainty regarding best-fit learning framework, with consensus reached regarding complexity of serving neurodivergent adults in post-secondary settings. An innovative framework titled “Building a Heutagogical Bridge” was envisioned, describing the role of heutagogy, student-centered, self-determined learning, in connecting signature pedagogical and andragogical approaches. This study revealed the potentiality of implementing and assessing approaches to skillfully incorporate heutagogical, pedagogical, and andragogical principles in higher education settings. The perspectives of faculty from the USA within this study can inform neurodiversity-affirming practice in American universities, while providing implications for future study and practice in international college settings, where contexts, needs, and culture may differ. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2023.},

It can be difficult to create relevant, authentic assessments that require students to display both synthesis of meaning, as well creative synthesis of concepts learned to reach this "create" level in an effective manner. Transformative learning and especially heutagogy or "self-determined learning" can be used as theoretical curriculum models or frameworks to help students learn and solve problems.

	abstract = {In Maldives’ primary schools, physical education (PE) is mainly taught by generalist classroom teachers who often lack knowledge and confidence to teach PE. Also, PE programs in primary schools are affected by a perceived lack of infrastructure, resources and equipment. Children in primary schools are allocated one 35 minute period of PE per week. Researchers have previously investigated interventions implemented by specialist PE teachers to enhance the motivation of secondary school students in PE classes. However, limited research has been conducted with generalist teachers’ implementing PE intervention with primary school children. In this study we applied self-determination theory to investigate the effects of a professional learning program and an associated resource support package, that was then delivered by the Maldives generalist teachers’ delivering PE. The participants were 30 primary school teachers (control group, n = 15; intervention group, n = 15), and their 725 primary school students aged 9–12 years (mean age of 10.5 years). The teachers in the group undertook eight hours of professional learning that focused on strategies and behaviours to support student satisfaction for the three main elements of self-determination theory: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. A repeated measure ANCOVA was carried out for each of the dependent variables. Overall results when compared to pre-intervention measures, the students of teachers in the intervention group significantly increased their post-intervention perceptions for autonomy, competence, and relatedness; and, increased their psychological need satisfaction. Moreover, intervention-students in the post-intervention phase reported reduced need frustration for autonomy, competence, and relatedness; and, experienced higher levels of self-efficacy, enjoyment and engagement. We contend that these results accentuate the usefulness of professional learning programs for generalist teachers delivering PE to promote students’ psychological need satisfaction, whilst reducing thwarting behaviours to enhance students’ self-determined motivation toward PE classes. The intervention program significantly enhanced the students’ perceived need support, and autonomous motivation, it also reduced teachers’ need frustrating behaviours within PE classes. Facilitating teachers to provide more moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and psychological need support could reduce the rate of non-communicable diseases that are currently prevalent in the Maldives. © 2022 Abdulla et al.

At the Division of Physiotherapy in the Department of Health Professions (Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH), Switzerland) the module ‘basic examination’–in the form of an objective structured examination (OSCE) and written exam–is scheduled in the first semester of the educational program. Objective: The primary aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of establishing GSS in an undergraduate physiotherapy degree program at the BFH. Secondary aim is to assess the effectiveness of GSS on the examination skills of first-semester undergraduate physiotherapy students will. Method: This paper describes the protocol of a randomized group-controlled educational feasibility study. 51 physiotherapy students from the first semester will be allocated into a guided self-study group (GSSG) or control group. The GSS takes place during the first semester, and consists of an eight-day cycle, with a presentation on the last day. Duration of this presentation is 90 min with supervision from a university lecturer. One week in advance of the presentation, the case and the learning goals are provided to the students electronically. The students prepare the cases in groups of five to six. The students are guided by the tutor during this preparation time. During a moderated plenum session, students present the results of group work and reflect upon the preparation phase and learning steps. Feasibility outcomes include the fidelity of implementation through exposure dosage, students’ responsiveness, program differentiation, and the degree of acceptability. Success criteria of feasibility are (1) exposure dosage as the number of 90-minute presentations that are conducted, and the content of cases and competences, (2) students’ responsiveness, with the aim of 100% willingness to participate, and (3) program differentiation, which will illustrate the alignment between GSS case content and the curriculum. Acceptability of intervention from the students’ perspective will be evaluated by a semi-structured interview. Secondary outcomes will be the achieved grades in the OSCE exams and written exams that demonstrate learning success. Conclusion: This feasibility study assesses the fidelity of implementation, the degree of acceptability and the effectiveness of GSS sessions on examination skills in undergraduate physiotherapy students at the BFH. Furthermore, this study will demonstrate whether guided self-study is feasible and can be implemented with fidelity in the BFH physiotherapy higher education curriculum. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The general concepts of deliberate practice and progressive problem-solving are considered in the context of teaching in higher education through the lens of research with nine UK National Teaching Fellows. It is suggested that the term ‘professional learning’ is more relevant to the development of expertise for teaching in higher education. A definition of professional learning is offered for teaching in higher education which places the teacher at the centre, developing their expertise through autonomous, self-determined and evidence-informed progressive problem-solving: an evidence-informed evolution of teaching practice motivated by curiosity, community and care. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Helen King; individual chapters, the contributors.},

Academagogy is an amalgamation of learning theories, viz. pedagogy (teacher-centered learning); andragogy (student-centered learning); and, heutagogy (self-determined learning). 10;While the original paper by McAuliffe et al. focused on the application of Academagogical principles to higher education in a university, this case study extends Academagogy into corporate training. Design/methodology/approach: Academagogy-based learning interventions were implemented in training programs conducted at IIC Academy. The study-sample comprised 144 trainees divided into the experiment and the control groups. Academagogical interventions were applied to the experiment group, whereas the control group followed conventional methods. Controlled quasi-experiment and statistical analyses were used as research tools in this case study. Findings: The performance scores of the participants' at entry-level were analyzed through propensity score matching and chi-square tests. The results concluded that the experiment and the control group had no selection bias. 10; 10;The treatment effect applied to the experiment group was studied using scatter-plots and effect size analyses. 10; 10;The results indicate that the academagogical interventions markedly improved behavioral and professional skills among participants of the experiment group, which showed up in their superior performance, both during training and at work. Research limitations/implications: This case study has two major limitations, viz. the sample population was homogenous; the batch-size was limited to 15 participants, which facilitated closer monitoring of the course. Originality/value: Academagogical interventions were implemented in a corporate setting as opposed to earlier studies which focused on a university setting and academic environs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Higher education plays a key role in cultivating graduate employability, which is essential to meeting multiple individual, community, social and labour market needs. Universities prioritise employability through strategic goals and initiatives designed to foster work-ready graduates equipped with the skills, aptitudes, and knowledge needed to navigate self-determined career pathways. One core approach to delivering on the employability agenda is through work-integrated learning (WIL). Despite institution’s efforts to set targets to increase access to WIL for all students, there is little evidence on how these strategies are implemented, reported, and revised, particularly in resource-depleted environments. This paper illuminates how institutional directives can be enacted when transformative learning is centralised through relational, collegial conversations. It builds on Dean et al.’s (2020) paper to unpack how the WIL Curriculum Classification (WILCC) Framework has been executed through employability champions across the institution, who advocate for meaningful, contextually appropriate change that is co-designed with colleagues. These ‘significant conversations’ are the impetus for transforming students’ learning experiences and career readiness. The paper offers four vignettes to showcase how the WILCC Framework has been implemented and disseminated across local, institutional, cross-campus and international contexts through transformative engagement in relational dialogue. It outlines key recommendations for holding significant conversations to influence change and champion the employability movement. © 2024 Deakin University. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {According to self-determination theory (SDT), the extent to which students’ motivation is self-determined is critical for academic performance. SDT also proposes that self-determined academic motivation is facilitated when the learning environment supports the basic psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence. This model of social support → needs satisfaction → motivation → learning outcomes is termed the general SDT model. Current evidence regarding this general SDT model is limited, in that, to date, no study has examined it in full using within-individual methods, which are critical for understanding inner psychological processes and mechanisms. Using a large and comprehensive college student dataset (total N of responses = 30,765), the current study aims to apply a within-individual analytical approach to the general SDT model. Specifically, we apply a cross-classified path model to account for both the between-student level and between-classroom level nesting structure. This model enables us to explain the relationships between the variables in the general SDT model on three levels: situational (within-student and within-classroom), between-student, and between-classroom. The results generally support the predictions on all three levels. For a student, a classroom, or a student's specific experience within a classroom, the general SDT model received support. Most importantly, when the same student in the same classroom experiences higher levels of autonomy support, she or he is more likely to have her or his psychological needs satisfied and to study for self-determined reasons, which are associated with higher perceived learning performance. Various unexpected results, such as the direct effects of learning climate and the predominance of the competence need, are also reported. Overall, the current research provides a comprehensive and multilevel understanding of the role of self-determination in college classrooms. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {A new era of student-centered learning, fueled by the power of digital tools and advanced teaching methods, means that classrooms are no longer entirely defined by four walls and a teacher at the leadership. At the same time, the educational landscape of African countries is very slowly adapting to these changes: the traditional face-to-face approach to learning dominates, student groups are overcrowded, and there is a significant gap in digital skills between students from urban and rural areas. Today, the development of online education becomes an important prerequisite for addressing the problem of educational disparity, a tool for meeting individual educational needs, increasing students' motivation and responsibility for their learning outcomes. The Self-Determined Learning Approach allows for a personalized learning environment in which students can choose what, how and when they learn, work at their pace, choose or receive learning tasks in an order that makes sense to them, which allows for the individual interests of each student, learning style, cultural identity, life experience and personal challenges. The research is based on the results of in-depth interviews with students aged between 25 and 37 years with work (2‒5 years) and study experience, who fit the profile of self-determined learners, have part-time distance learning experience, are employed in different positions and are currently studying different programs, and are also registered with one of the three Distance Education Institutions. All participants are in their final year of study and have experienced digital transformation in distance education. This qualitative study is based on a constructivist paradigm employing a phenomenological strategy to explain the perceptions of students regarding how self-determined practices are applied at their institutions. The phenomenological approach aimed to capture the lived experiences of these students, focusing on their descriptions and interpretations of encountering self-determination practices in their educational environment. The results of the study confirmed the value of a self-determined approach to learning and its positive impact on enhancing students' workplace adaptability. However, at the same time, the survey revealed that African higher education institutions are not ready for the effective implementation of self-determined learning technologies, the main reasons being the lack of technology and the unpreparedness of teachers. © 2024 by the author.},

However, few studies have examined the psychological mechanisms that promote sustainable purchase intention from the perspective of VR education. Based on the self-determined motivation theory and VR attributes, this study proposes and empirically examines the underlying mechanism of VR customer knowledge education on sustainable purchase intention. The results show that VR customer knowledge education has a positive effect on customers’ sustainable product knowledge levels, and subsequently, on sustainable purchase intention through the two mediators of knowledge richness and usefulness. Additionally, customers’ intrinsic (versus extrinsic) learning motivation leads to a higher sustainable knowledge enhancement effect. Nonetheless, this effect is moderated by customers’ prior sustainable knowledge; customers with low (versus high) prior sustainable knowledge are more susceptible to the effects of VR customer knowledge education. © 2023, HARD Publishing Company.

	abstract = {Previous research has shown that motivation, epistemic beliefs, and perceived social support each have an effect on the way students engage in their learning and can promote a deep approach. The first aim of this study was to measure and compare these effects. Some authors have argued that epistemic beliefs and perceived social support do not have a direct effect on approach to learning, but that this effect is mediated by motivation. The second aim of this study was to examine this hypothesis and, more specifically, to determine the extent to which the effects of evaluativist epistemic beliefs and perceived social support promote a deep approach to learning directly or indirectly through self-determined and controlled motivation. We adopted a cross-sectional study design and focused on the first year of university. This study is based on the responses of 2168 French first year university students to a questionnaire. Linear regression shows that the strongest factor predicting a deep approach to learning is self-determined motivation, followed by evaluativism, and that the weakest factor is perceived social support, which is nevertheless a significant factor. Controlled motivation was found to have a weak negative effect. Mediation analyses, with self-determined motivation as a mediator, show the existence of both direct and indirect significant effects of evaluativism and perceived social support on deep approach to learning. These findings have important educational implications in that they help to identify key levers that teachers can activate to engage their students in deeper learning. © Instituto Universitário de Ciências Psicológicas, Sociais e da Vida 2023.},

	abstract = {The gender digital divide (GDD) is a social phenomenon that denies citizens access to technologies, the internet, and the services associated with Education 4.0. Reducing this gap requires communicative literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which emphasize the use of technology, self-determined learning, and collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the participation of 124 Mexican students of technical-professional education. The study’s objective was to analyze how they scaled their communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico. Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic thinking (z = –2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly higher mean (M = 25.36) than men (M = 25.11). Qualitative results support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90%). This suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively enhance communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they can be spaces where both women and men achieve similar levels of digital literacy. © 2024 The Author(s).},

Overall, this study offers valuable contributions to the empirical evidence and body of literature on heutagogy by providing an extended understanding of the mediating role of heutagogical activities in postgraduates’ self-determined learning.

Cultivating classroom environments that support international students’ success requires the consideration of cultural, psychological, and motivational factors. Following an integrated framework of Self-Determination Theory (SDT: Ryan & Deci, 2018) and Culturally Relevant/Responsive Pedagogy, Teaching and Education (CRPTE: Aronson & Laughter, 2016; Gay, 2018; Ladson-Billings, 1995, 2014), we examined if international students’ perceptions of autonomy supportive and culturally responsive environments predicted their general and intercultural willingness to communicate and oral participation through basic psychological needs, self-determined motivation, and communication anxiety in U.S. university classrooms. Data from 397 nonnative English-speaking and 113 native English-speaking international students from one institution were analyzed using structural equation modeling and path analysis. Results supported the significant roles of perceived autonomy supportive and culturally responsive environments in communication and participation outcomes. This study responds to a recent trend for motivation research to integrate cultural perspectives, addresses international students’ needs in the era of active learning, and extends willingness to communicate research beyond the previous scope. We discuss theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for motivation research and teaching and learning in higher education. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {As 'self-law', autonomy contributes to people's psychological health and helps secure meaning in one’s life. Within higher education, it enables students to navigate this environment and prepare for professional life, empowering them to take ownership of their learning and development goals. Autonomy is multidimensional, encompassing the local ability to regulate thoughts and behaviours, and the global ability to establish a sense of existential agency; therefore, it is vital to students’ holistic progression and attainment. Within a relational context, interpersonal relationships influence people’s ability to recognise and exercise their autonomous capacities across local and global contexts. Therefore, fostering students’ autonomy is at the heart of support services within Higher Education Institutions. Student Advisers are well placed to undertake this mission, given the range of academic, administrative, and pastoral responsibilities their role entails. In this paper we provide a taxonomy of student autonomy, arguing it is ‘becoming oneself amongst others’. Given autonomy’s relational foundations, a healthy student-adviser connection can provide an environment for students to operate in a co-directive and self-determined manner. Drawing on University College Dublin’s Student Advisory Services, we offer guidance to Student Advisers, proposing two autonomy enhancement strategies: fostering students' self-governance through facilitating intrapersonal ownership and fostering their self-direction by promoting interpersonal embeddedness. © 2023 Educational Studies Association of Ireland.},

	abstract = {Background: The dynamic nature of physical education (PE) requires careful consideration of lesson planning and delivery in order to promote health and wellbeing and to achieve various learning goals. One such goal is promoting personal and social development to support students to value and lead a healthy and active lifestyle, especially during transition into adolescence. In order to design learning environments that support students’ engagement in PE, it is important to understand how outcomes such as motor competence (MC) influence motivation for PE. There are two approaches to understand MC, actual and perceived MC, and both have implications for healthy lifestyles in childhood and adolescence. Therefore, this study examined associations of actual and perceived MC with young adolescents’ motivation for PE. Method: A sample of 236 students 11–14 years of age (M = 13.01, SD =.72) participated in the study. Assessments included actual MC (Körperkoordinations test for Kinder; KTK), perceived MC (self-administered form of the pictorial scale of Perceived Movement Skill Competence; PMSC) and motivation for PE (Perceived Locus of Causality Scale; PLOC). Polynomial regression with Response Surface Analyses were conducted to examine the influence of actual and perceived MC on motivation for PE. Findings: The results showed weak-to-moderate positive associations of actual and perceived MC with students’ motivation for PE. Perceived MC explained about 12% of the variance of student’s self-determined motivation towards PE. This effect was larger in students with lower levels of perceived MC compared to students with higher levels of perceived MC. Discussion: Taking into account that both actual and perceived MC are synergistically related but only perceived MC explains self-determined motivation, our results suggest that perceived MC is an important factor to consider when attempting to promote an active and healthy lifestyle. Using the developmental model of motor competence [Stodden et al. 2008. “A Developmental Perspective on the Role of Motor Skill Competence in Physical Activity: An Emergent Relationship.” Quest 60 (2): 290–306] and self-determination theory [Deci and Ryan 2000. “The “What” and “Why” of Goal Pursuits: Human Needs and the Self-Determination of Behavior.” Psychological Inquiry 11 (4): 227–268. doi:10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01], we discuss the findings in relation to the importance of considering perceived MC as an explicit outcome in the PE curriculum. Conclusion: During early adolescence, PE programs should not only focus on teaching movement skills but also fostering perceived MC in order to promote motivation for PE, especially among students with lower levels of self-perception. For this, pedagogical approaches such as need supportive teaching derived from self-determination theory can be used to help students become competent, confident and motivated movers. © 2020 Association for Physical Education.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates how psychological needs spurring self-determined motivation relate to collective efficacy for flourishing in online learning communities. Self-determination theory posits individuals experience intrinsic motivation to flourish at educational tasks because of targeted satisfaction of the three psychological needs: autonomy, relatedness, and competence. However, studies conducted to investigate collective, technology-assisted learning processes suggest competence and relatedness may play a pivotal role in online community engagement and knowledge-sharing. Moreover, informal gaming experiences may mirror the collaborative skills needed in online educational/professional communities. These insights suggest confidence in one’s abilities to contribute to a community, the perception of a strong, supportive social culture in the online classroom, and informal online experiences may lead to self-determined motivation enabling agents in distributed, technology-assisted classrooms to collectively flourish. Little work has been done to examine effects of need satisfaction on collective efficacy in using online technologies. To fill this research gap, we used structural equation modelling to investigate perceptions of 636 undergraduate students enrolled in classes within an education department at a midwestern university employing weekly asynchronous blogging. Our results suggest students’ experience with multiplayer gaming, and need satisfaction towards competence and relatedness correlate with higher collective efficacy in technology-assisted classrooms employing discussion forums. Implications for practice or policy: • For instructors, student usership and design can spur motivation in online classrooms. • For researchers, understanding student perceptions of collaboration using technology can help understand how to design better technology-assisted classrooms. • The design of collaborative online educational communities should focus on creating positive social cultures and fostering competence for students © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

Participation led to structured experiences and opportunities to practice self-determined behaviors in an environment built to support the development of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The three major themes identified (struggle, community, and resilience) corresponded with experiences before, during, and after participation in I’m Determined. The major theme of struggle encompassed experiences at school and not understanding their disability. The theme of community affected participants in the context of disability awareness and opportunity. Resilience necessitated a change in mindset and the ability to overcome barriers. Altering classroom environments to support autonomy, competence, and relatedness is one way to reproduce the supports that led to these participants’ success. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2022.},

The existing literature offers evidence of student satisfaction with assignments directed at appealing to external audiences, however, the literature provides no comprehensive pedagogical rationale for assignments directed at authentic audiences wherein the goals are self-determined. The authors discuss the theory of heutagogy, the study of self-determined learning, as an approach for assessing assignments that utilize ICTs and are directed at authentic audiences.

Research purpose: The study aimed to empirically explore managerial expectations of new graduate employability attributes and what managers are prepared to do to enable new graduates in this regard. Motivation for the study: Not being able to find qualified candidates hampers productivity. In addition, it also limits new graduates’ prospects of finding sustainable employment. Research approach/design and method: This study is based on responses of 17 respondents from the North West, Gauteng and Northern Free State provinces of South Africa. Responses were obtained through a qualitative online survey. The researchers analysed the data using qualitative content analysis. Main findings: Six main attributes were extracted from the data: Being self-determined (making choices and managing their own lives); harnessing knowledge and learning (using and developing knowledge and skills); having a positive attitude (solving problems and dealing with challenges and setbacks); believing in oneself (having humility and self-confidence); having good relationships with others (being sensitive towards the organisational culture and relating well to others) and managerial capacity building (managers’ coaching and mentor roles that are critical to enable new graduates). Practical/managerial implications: Understanding managerial expectations should guide industry, higher education institutions and government in developing evidence-based interventions focussing on the relevant aspects of new graduate employability attributes. Contribution/value-add: The findings of this study provides an empirically grounded description of six broad new graduate attributes that managers value. © 2023. The Authors.},

This paper addresses two research questions: What do engineering students expect from a learning app? Which educational approach and learning app design can meet these requirements? A survey revealed the particular demands of engineering students when using learning apps. They prefer apps that promote transfer of learning. They value a diversified game environment that leaves room for self-determined decisions. They want to use learning apps during five-minute breaks or on-the-go. Social interaction is only of minor importance. Concrete design and content guidelines are derived. Perceptual learning is an appropriate educational approach to meet the requirements. Two universally applicable task types for engineering education are discussed. A case study was conducted to investigate their use in practice. Following the guidelines, an app for heat-and-mass-transfer was generated and its impact on teaching was evaluated. Students considered that their requirements were met. This is reflected in the usage statistics: During one semester, 545 different students played a total of 27,350 games. As a measure of learning progress, the average score per game almost tripled. Apps that follow the guidelines have the potential to become well-accepted learning tools. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In South Africa, the Council for Higher Education (CHE) requires that learning and teaching at higher education institutions (HEIs) must be informed by research done by universities. With high dropout rates these aspirations are not attainable. The question that this study addresses is: firstly, what motivates emerging researchers and postgraduate students to enrol for research and postgraduate programmes at a South African higher education institution, and secondly, what motivates them to complete their studies. Following a qualitative approach, this case study explores self-determination awareness among a group of master’s students in a supervisory context. It interrogates requisite metaliteracy competencies and the core metacognitive attributes underpinning human motivation. The aim is to ascertain how students doing research could be supported and developed to become self-directed and motivated to conduct and complete quality research. The value of the study lies in adding new knowledge to an under-explored area and to propose steps to close the current gap. © 2024 Proceedings of the International Conference on Education Research, ICER 2024.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented exposure to Potentially Morally Injurious Events (PMIEs) for nurses, in which they were both moral transgressors and moral victims, with deleterious consequences on their psycho-social health and functioning. Our experimental design compared memories of PMIEs with memories of severe moral transgressions (SMTs), in which participants were only moral transgressors. Drawing from Self-Determination Theory and research on moral auto-biographical episodic memories, we assessed a conceptual model describing the impact of recalling a single PMIE or SMT event on nurses’ burnout, work satisfaction and adaptive performance. Our convenience sample comprised 614 Romanian nurses, and data was analyzed with path analysis, general linear modelling, and t-tests. Findings showed that memories of PMIEs, compared to SMTs, were more autonomy thwarting, being associated with more controlled work motivation, less moral learning, higher burnout, less work satisfaction, and adaptive performance. Burnout, moral learning, and work satisfaction were significant mediators of the relationships between PMIE and SMT recall and, respectively, adaptive performance. Our results highlight the urgency for organizational practices of moral repair for nurses after the pandemic, along with interventions meant to increase their autonomy and self-determined work motivation. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Intelligent voice assistants (IVAs), such as Siri or Alexa, are voice-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems that help users solve everyday tasks using voice commands. Users often have a superficial understanding of the full range of functions IVAs can be used for and how to use them effectively. Since higher knowledge of device and system handling is fundamental for positive interaction quality and self-determined use of IVAs, this study examines how training can contribute to the promotion of variables such as usage aspects, social perception, and self-determined interaction and how such training can be designed. Based on an established competence framework and the principles of learning psychology and media didactics, three online training modules were developed to strengthen the user's device and system handling competence, and their effects on the parameters of competent AI interaction were investigated. A total of 110 students took part in the three training studies. Results of dependent t-tests show that completing training modules improves device and system handling and increases the intention to use IVAs more self-determined. In detail, participants perceive IVAs as more useful, tend to be more explorative and indulgent, feel more competent to use IVAs, and perceive them as less disturbing. Overall, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of training in improving the perceived usefulness of IVAs, exploratory and indulgent behavioral intentions, and decreasing the disturbance of IVAs. This work has great potential for research and education to improve, explore, and advance user behavior and competent interaction with IVAs, as well as for broader AI applications. © 2025 The Authors},

In addition, a large volume of evidence has claimed that China's government is putting a blindfold on VET outcomes, which results in incompetent graduates who do not fit in with the current industrial workforce need. Hence, a self-determination theory furnished this study to underpin the effectiveness of the training and derive plans or strategies which foster the training program. Thus, the present study administered a national survey of (N = 5083) to vocational students to examine their self-determined learning motivation by determining the specific times, places, and individuals who need a feasible intervention to engage in VET work and help make the country's industrial production competent at the world market level. Hence, our study findings shed light on vocational students in China who lose their learning motivation over time; those with other alternatives drop out of the program. Those who are desperate continue without an adequate practical skill level, given that they have to get a job to help their poor parents. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

A total of 715 adolescents (of whom 371 (51.89%) were girls) participated. The ages ranged from 14 to 18 years, with mean ages of 16.00 (SD = 0.79) for girls and 15.99 (SD = 0.75) for boys. The study questionnaire consisted of demographic questions and the Learning Climate Questionnaire, Revised Perceived Locus of Causality in Physical Education Questionnaire, Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire 2, Self-Report Habit Index for Physical Activity, Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, perceived physical fitness and frequency of non-participation in PE classes. The results showed that perceived teacher autonomy support was directly positively associated with physical activity habits and negatively with non-participation in physical education classes. Autonomous motivation for PE was a mediator between perceived teacher autonomy support and physical activity habits, meaning that higher autonomous motivation was related to higher physical activity habits. Motivation for PE was also a mediator between teacher autonomy support and non-participation in PE. Higher autonomous motivation for PE was associated with less frequent non-participation in PE classes. The findings can inform PE teachers’ practice by showing that supporting students’ autonomy and strengthening their self-determined motivation can facilitate increased participation in PE classes and the formation of students’ physical activity habits. © 2022 by the authors.},

For this purpose, two groups of 68 and 72 higher education students participated in blended and distance career interventions, respectively. The blended program took place in a curricular infusion context, and was subject to assessment, while the distance program was fully voluntary. Students were assessed with pre-and post-tests regarding four career resources’ dimensions. Motivation over program experience was assessed after the intervention. The results indicate that despite some differences between the two modalities, both career interventions were effective, with gains in three of the four assessed career resources’ dimensions. Relatedness was higher in the blended format of the program, while participants in the distance format reported experiencing higher levels of autonomy during the program. Despite that, motivation variables did not present a relevant predictive power in career resources’ gains obtained through participation in the program. Implications for practice include the possibility of infusing the program into curricula of higher education degrees as a way of increasing program completion and reaching different audiences and highlighting the importance of using multiple approaches to broaden its reach. © 2025, Publications Service of the University of A Coruna - Elvina Campus.

As the field gains momentum, understanding its research landscape is essential for guiding future pedagogical practices and scholarship. We conducted a bibliometric review of 290 publications from 2005 to 2024 indexed in the Scopus database, applying PRISMA guidelines and defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. VOSviewer was used to analyze citation networks, co-authorship patterns, and keyword co-occurrences. Findings show a significant increase in publications, peaking in 2020, with Blaschke identified as the most cited author and Cochrane as the most prolific. Auckland University led institutional contributions. The research spans disciplines such as education, computer science, and business, with thematic focuses on educational technology, lifelong learning, and 21st-century skills. However, collaboration remains largely regional, indicating opportunities for broader international engagement. The review highlights heutagogy's growing impact on flexible and technology-enhanced learning environments. These insights have practical implications for curriculum development, instructional design, and educational policy. Conclusively, heutagogy is poised to play a transformative role in higher education, particularly in promoting autonomy, adaptability, and lifelong learning.

	abstract = {The approach that students take in their studies at university is critical not only for their academic success but is equally important in life-long learning for their career and professional development. Heutagogy is the study of self-determined learning and it is important that we appraise how students in higher education are developing their metacognitive awareness in how they learn and study effectively. Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary research area that involves the scientific study of the human mind. It helps provide new knowledge in relation to areas such as memory, problem solving, knowledge transfer and understanding of complex topics. Cognitive science has demonstrated that re-testing oneself on material when learning, enhances and promotes greater retention of knowledge compared to re-reading the material. Learning that is distributed or spaced out over multiple study sessions also allows for greater retention of knowledge in the longer-term compared to ‘cramming’ of information. To evaluate the use of effective study approaches and habits across three different levels of study in an undergraduate pharmacy programme, a survey study was employed. A paper-based survey was completed by first-, second- and third-year undergraduate pharmacy students (n=192) during class sessions. Although there was some evidence of metacognitive awareness such as using testing (retrieval practice) with practice problems; across all years, suboptimal study approaches such as rereading, copying notes and cramming were endorsed. A schedule of deadlines shaped the organisation of study and time management for most students. Self-testing was predominantly used to test learning rather than an approach used during learning. There was evidence of a difference between the cohorts in relation to decisions for prioritizing studying, returning to review course material and re-reading. The evidence from this study demonstrates that learners would require training on metacognitive awareness and effective study strategies to enable their self-determined learning capabilities to evolve. The linear progression through a programme of study alone will not achieve this. There is a need to embed and emphasize effective strategies for learning into curricula and for faculty to utilise metacognitive awareness in their teaching. Practitioner Notes 1. Self-determined learning places an expectation that learners self-regulate and take responsibility for their learning. Student’s independent study within a programme helps to consolidate learning. 2. Study habits and preferences vary among individuals however there is clear evidence from cognitive science that not all study approaches are effective. 3. Undergraduate students are using suboptimal study methods such as rereading notes, recopying notes and cramming information the night before a test. Self-testing was predominantly used to test learning rather than an approach used during learning. 4. Students report that they are not using approaches taught to them by teachers. It has been shown that learners incorrectly predict suboptimal methods as superior to evidence-based approaches. We suggest that evidence-based study approaches are explicitly emphasised and embedded within courses. 5. We recommend to senior managers with learning and teaching remits (Directors of Learning and Teaching, Pro Vice-Chancellors for Education and Student Experience) that faculty staff are informed about evidence-based learning approaches from cognitive science and increase metacognitive awareness in their teaching. © 2022, University of Wollongong.

	abstract = {Objectives: Almost every state includes content standards that are closely related to skills associated with self-determination (e.g., decision making, planning, problem solving, goal setting and attainment). Additionally, research in both general and special education has demonstrated a close relationship between the promotion of self-determination and positive school (e.g., academic goal attainment) and post-school (e.g., employment) outcomes. Therefore, this study examines implementation of an evidence-based intervention to promote self-determination in inclusive, general education classrooms. Methods: This study utilized multilevel linear modeling to examine changes in student self-determination in secondary mathematics classes after a year of exposure to The Self-Determined Learning Model of Instruction (SDLMI). Participants included were 81 students ranging from 10th to 12th grade learning in secondary mathematics classes (Algebra II, Pre-Calculus, and Advanced Placement Calculus). Results: The findings demonstrated a small, positive effect on student self-determination and that goal attainment during the first semester predicted second semester goal attainment. Specifically, the inclusion of goal attainment as a predictor explained 10% of the variability in self-determination observed, corresponding to a small effect. Overall, students who attained at higher level of goal attainment had higher self-determination at the conclusion of the study and were expected to grow in their self-determination at a higher rate than those with lower levels of goal attainment. Conclusion: The results from this study suggest that implementing the SDLMI to support all students in secondary mathematics classes positively impacts student attainment of skills that impact self-determination and has the potential to impact mathematical learning in future research. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Teachers need research competence to reflect on their teaching and to interpret and implement research-based recommendations. However, many pre-service teachers have critical attitudes toward research, little motivation to engage in research, and comparatively low knowledge of research methods and thereby consequently indicating a low research competence. Flexible online modules in university teaching could be a promising approach to address these issues. Online modules can potentially promote self-determined motivation, but should be sufficiently structured to support learners’ need for competence. Methods: We designed two learning environments with different types of structure: a non-restrictive structured environment and a restrictive structured environment. A total of N = 108 pre-service biology teachers were randomly assigned to the two learning environments. Results and discussion: Contrary to our assumption, the restrictive type of structure of the learning environment did not lead to a higher perception of competence. This might be a consequence of external pressure, for example, the examination at the end of the course. Regarding pre-service teachers’ research competence, we found a decrease in the affective-motivational domain and an increase in the cognitive domain in both learning environments. These results suggest that fostering pre-service teachers’ research competence should focus on the affective-motivational domain. In order to positively affect this domain, care must be taken to ensure that structuring elements are not experienced as control and that given choices are meaningful to students.

The present study aimed to investigate how international students adapt to new academic environments in US universities by exploring the relationships between self-determined motivation, beliefs about classroom assessments, the use of self-regulatory learning strategies, and academic performance based on self-determination theory. To examine international students’ learning experiences, 321 international Asian undergraduate students at a large research-intensive midwestern university participated in an online survey. Structural equation modeling was conducted to test the proposed model. The findings demonstrated that self-determined motivation in courses led to adaptive beliefs about classroom assessments, which promoted a variety of self-regulatory learning strategies, including shallow and metacognitive strategies. Metacognitive learning strategies were significantly related to students’ academic performance. This study allows us to better understand how Asian international students adapt to US academic environments through their motivation to learn, perspectives about classroom assessments, and learning strategies across different academic disciplines at the university level. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

The objectives of the study were to describe and determine the relationship between the level of self-determined motivation and emotional intelligence of secondary school students in physical education classes and to test for gender and age differences in both variables. Method. To this purpose, a total of 607 students between 12 and 18 years of age (M = 14.911; SD = 1.46) from three schools in the Region of Murcia participated in the study. Participants were administered the Spanish adaptation of the Sport Motivation Scale-II adapted to Physical Education to measure the individual level of motivation towards Physical Education and the Spanish version of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale to measure perceived emotional intelligence. Results. The main results showed that the most self-determined types of motivation correlated positively with the dimensions of emotional intelligence (attention, clarity and repair). Boys had higher averages than girls in all forms of motivation except amotivation, and also showed higher values for emotional clarity, while girls had higher averages for emotional attention. Discussion. The results are encouraging for this subject, since according to the results and following the literature, most students enjoy learning and participating in class, despite age differences. While boys show a greater understanding of its relevance and benefits, which motivates them to participate more actively for enjoyment, girls tend to pay more attention to their emotions. In conclusion is necessary to promote more internal motivation in order to improve emotional intelligence in secondary education students, especially in girls. © 2025, Universidad Compultense Madrid.

	abstract = {The present study investigated whether online students’ sense of community and self-determined need satisfaction predicted online course satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of 136 Australian university students who were studying online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students completed online surveys for sense of community (i.e., social connectedness and learning community), self-determined need satisfaction (i.e., relatedness, competence, and autonomy), and online course satisfaction. The study results indicated that learning community and social connectedness significantly predicted the self-determined needs and online course satisfaction, with learning community having a large effect size. Autonomy partially mediated the relationship between social connectedness and online course satisfaction; autonomy was the only self-determined need to predict online course satisfaction. It was concluded that online university students require learning communities and social connectedness to meet their needs and have a satisfying learning experience. The self-determined need of autonomy was the most important for student’s satisfaction with their course. These findings have implications for universities to build a sense of community in their courses to support students' needs and improve online course satisfaction. Practitioner Notes 1. The COVID-19 pandemic changed the experience of university students in 2020. 2.

	abstract = {Preparing students for the complex and changing nature of the workforce has become an overriding objective within higher education. New pedagogies, which incorporate both informal and formal learning and support personalization of learning, are central to this objective. Educators are required to reassess the use of traditional pedagogies, as they attempt to foster development of skills and competencies for lifelong learning. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is a learning theory that addresses this need, giving students agency in determining what and how they learn. The theory is based in the principles of learner agency, capability and self-efficacy, reflection and metacognition, and non-linear learning, and when used with technology can be a powerful instructional approach for building students’ self-directed and lifelong learning skills. A compelling example of this is the e-portfolio. As a platform and assessment tool, the e-portfolio spans the spectrum of lifelong learning, as well as encompasses both formal and informal learning of the individual learner and addresses critical aspects of learning and reflection, showcasing the learner’s acquired skills and competencies. Based on successful cases in the literature, this article discusses the principles of heutagogy, the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH continuum) and its application in online learning environments, and the use of the e-portfolio in further cultivating and advancing self-determined learning. The article also offers recommendations for future practice and theory. © 2020 Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the swift pivot to online learning, teachers and students have been forced to adopt a new way of teaching and learning, which has required students to become more self-directed in their learning. In addition, teachers are faced with the challenge of preparing students for the workforce and lifelong learning. One emerging approach for addressing both these challenges is that of heutagogy, or self-determined learning. This paper discusses the rising demand for lifelong learning skills and the role that heutagogy can play in supporting students in developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Specifically, the paper presents a case study of a higher education institution that has introduced heutagogy, using interviews with programme leaders/instructors to investigate how a college in Israel incorporated heutagogy into their master's education programmes. Case study results reveal that there are challenges in incorporating heutagogy (eg, difficulty for students in adopting the approach), but once adopted, students preferred learning in a self-determined way. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? Lifelong learning skills are critical to student employability, and there is a need for exploring new theories and approaches for developing these skills. The current pandemic has forced traditional learning into the online space, requiring more self-directed learning skills in learners. Heutagogy has been identified as a net-centric teaching and learning theory for online learning. What this paper adds Positions heutagogy for use in traditional and online classroom settings in order to develop learners' self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Explores the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum and its use as an instructional strategy. Presents a case study of a higher education institution that has implemented self-determined learning. Implications for practice and/or policy This study encourages further research into use of heutagogy for developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills. This study provides guidance for those who want to introduce self-determined learning into classroom settings. © 2021 British Educational Research Association.},

	abstract = {Developing therapeutic relationship skills as well as clinical skill confidence is critical for nursing students. While the nursing literature has examined multiple factors that influence student learning, little is known about the role of student motivation in skill development in non-traditional placement settings. Although therapeutic skills and clinical confidence are vital across a variety of contexts, here we focus on its development in mental health settings. The present study aimed to investigate whether the motivational profiles of nursing students varied with the learning associated with developing (1) a therapeutic relationship in mental health and (2) mental health clinical confidence. We examined students’ self-determined motivation and skill development within an immersive, work-integrated learning experience. Undergraduate nursing students (n = 279) engaged in five-day mental health clinical placement, “Recovery Camp,” as part of their studies. Data were collected via the Work Task Motivation Scale, Therapeutic Relationship Scale and the Mental Health Clinical Confidence Scale. Students were ranked into either high (top-third), moderate (mid-third) or low (bottom-third) motivation-level groups. These groups were compared for differences in Therapeutic Relationship and Mental Health Clinical Confidence scores. Students higher in motivation reported significantly higher therapeutic relationship skills (Positive Collaboration, p <.001; Emotional Difficulties, p <.01). Increased student motivation was also associated with greater clinical confidence compared to each lower-ranked motivation group (p ≤.05). Our findings show that student motivation plays a meaningful role in pre-registration learning. Non-traditional learning environments may be uniquely placed to influence student motivation and enhance learning outcomes. © 2023 The Author(s).

Previous research has suggested that visiting an outreach science lab can be beneficial in terms of student motivation. Nevertheless, the current research on these out-of-school learning environments lacks studies that investigate important variables for the development of self-determined student motivation, such as perceived competence. In our study, we investigated the moderating effect of the learning environment on the relationship between students' contextual competence perceptions and their situational competence experiences regarding experimentation. For this purpose, 119 students in the first year of the upper secondary school participated in an experimental course on enzymology at an outreach science lab (n = 60) and in their biology classroom at school (n = 59). Our results showed that the relationship between students' contextual competence perceptions and their situational competence experiences during experimentation is moderated by the learning environment. The analyses revealed that students with a higher contextual competence perception showed comparable situational experiences of competence in both learning environments. In contrast, the students who perceived themselves as less competent at a contextual level benefited from experimenting at the outreach science lab in terms of their situational competence experiences.

However, the lack of analysis conducted on item level for validating the measurement of postgraduate students’ self-determined learning skills prompted the development of The Postgraduate Self-determined Learning Questionnaire (PSLQ) to fill in the research gaps. This paper aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the newly developed 42-item instrument through a mixed method approach as no study has evaluated the psychometric properties of PSLQ at the item level through Rasch model analysis. Quantitatively, 440 postgraduate students were sampled from a higher education institution in Malaysia to answer the questionnaire. Qualitatively, 10 respondents from science and non-science disciplines were interviewed. The paper reports findings on the psychometric properties of PSLQ through Rasch Rating Analysis and participants’ perspectives on the item validity. The results revealed that the items in PSLQ demonstrated good psychometric properties for the measurement of self-determined learning skills of postgraduate students. Implications of the study were discussed in this paper. Future studies can further investigate the psychometric properties of PSLQ according to students’ discipline of study. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Purpose To date, didactic lecturing is a common method of university medical training. However, higher levels of competence to solve complex issues are hardly to be achieved with a largely passive learning style. We established and evaluated a heutagogical blended learning concept to investigate self-determined learning with a multimedia-based, interactive approach in the lecture room to teach clinical radiology. Materials and Methods In the 2019/2020 winter semester, we included 266 medical students in their fourth academic year in our prospective, observational study. Students participated in a series of 11 radiological lectures given by 10 lecturers. They were requested to prepare for lectures by watching learning videos. During the lecture, students had to answer key-feature questions (KFQ) in small groups and to jointly submit their answers by means of an audience response system (ARS). After each lecture and the exam, we conducted surveys and compared results with a historical control group. A focus group interview with lecturers was performed after conclusion of the lecture series. Results The students' overall impression of the flipped classroom concept and their examination grades were superior to historical controls (overall impression: 1.5 [95 % CI 1.4-1.6] vs. 2.7 [95 % CI 2.5-2.9] rated on a scale from 1 to 6, p < 0.001; examination grades: 1.8 [95 % CI 1.7-1.9] vs. 2.0 [95 % CI 1.9-2.0] rated on a scale from 1 to 5, p < 0.001). Most students agreed that learning videos (76.6 %), ARS (88.5 %), KFQ (76.5 %), and solution-oriented small group discussions (83.7 %) were useful. Lecturers stated an improved convergence of demands on learning and clinical competence. However, they also emphasized an increased initial effort for implementation. Conclusion Students rated the overall benefit from the heutagogical flipped classroom concept as high. Examination grades improved. According to lecturers, the flipped classroom concept better matched later professional demands than traditional lectures. Key Points: The benefit of the flipped classroom concept for radiological lectures was rated high by students. Most students were satisfied with the multimedia and interactive elements of lectures. Lecturers considered heutagogical learning demands as appropriate for later clinical requirements. Citation Format Teichgräber U, Ingwersen M, Mentzel H et al.

Results support the hypothesis that self-determination components affect postsecondary school enrollment. English learners with disabilities with higher autonomy scores were more likely to enroll in 2-year colleges, and those with higher empowerment scores were more likely to enroll in 4-year colleges. However, prior research found that English learners with disabilities are less likely to act autonomously or report empowerment-related behaviors than other students with disabilities or students in the general population.

	abstract = {Background: Active learning pedagogy has recently received a great deal of attention, and many universities have attempted to create student-centered learning environments to improve students’ academic success. The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of concept-point-recovery (CPR) teaching sessions as an active learning strategy on students’ perceptions of the learning environment, motivation, and academic learning outcomes in an electrical engineering course. To investigate the effectiveness of CPR sessions, students’ perceptions of learning and their performance were compared to those of students in a control classroom. Finally, students’ written comments on the course and instructor were explored in further analysis. Results: The quantitative findings revealed that there was a significant change in students’ perceptions of learning after the CPR teaching sessions, and there was an increase in students’ perceptions and learning outcomes compared with those of the control group. In addition, the qualitative findings from students’ written feedback demonstrated that students felt that the instructor cared about students’ learning and success and that they had a positive learning environment. Conclusions: CPR teaching sessions can be an alternative model for instructors to connect with students and create supportive environments to help students achieve academic success, which in turn promotes the satisfaction of students’ basic psychological needs and self-determined motivation. Therefore, increasing students’ engagement in their learning processes and making connections with students through CPR teaching sessions can facilitate improvements in students’ motivation and academic success. How this new active learning technique can be applied to higher education is discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Concerns about body image might prevent adolescents from participating in physical education (PE) classes and physical activities during leisure-time. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the relationships between teacher support of autonomy, student motivations for PE, and positive body image, in a sample of Lithuanian adolescents. A total of 715 adolescents (51.89% girls) participated in the study. Ages ranged from 14 to 18 years, with a mean age of 16.00 (SD = 0.79) for girls and 15.99 (SD = 0.75) for boys. The questionnaire consisted of demographic questions, the Learning Climate Questionnaire, the Revised Perceived Locus of Causality in Physical Education Questionnaire, the Body Appreciation Scale-2, the Self-Report Habit Index for Physical Activity (PA), perceived physical fitness (PPF), and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. The results showed that teacher support for students’ autonomy was associated with higher positive body image. In adolescent girls, autonomous motivation for PE was the mediator between teacher support of autonomy and positive body image. The associations between self-determined motivation in PE and positive body image were mediated by PPF on one hand, and through PA habits and PPF on the other hand of the structural equation model (in girls). PA habits moderated associations between PE motivation and PPF. Associations between PE motivation and PPF were stronger in girls with the lowest PA habits compared to girls with mean PA habits. These results suggest that PE classes are important for promoting students’ positive body images. PE teachers are advised to use pedagogical strategies that promote the self-determined motivation of students for PE. Increased self-determined motivation for physical education might be an effective strategy for physical self-perception and positive body image promotion in adolescent girls, especially those with low PA habits. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Over the last few years, the Meaningful Physical Education (PE) approach has emerged as a framework aimed at transforming PE experiences into relevant and positive for all students. To date, most of the existing research on Meaningful PE has been conducted in English-speaking contexts, using qualitative research designs and mainly on teachers. This focus has left three notable gaps that the present study tried to address: the use of quantitative research designs, the exploration of the framework in other cultural contexts, and a focus on students’ perceptions. In addition, factors like gender and school level, which significantly influence how students perceive and value the subject, remain underexplored. For this study, the Meaningful PE features identified in the Spanish context were included (i.e. social interaction, challenge, personally relevant learning, fun, motor competence, novelty, teacher interpersonal style, and relief). Purpose: The present study aimed to address three main research gaps: (1) to analyse the relationships between the eight Meaningful PE features using a quantitative design, (2) to explore potential differences based on students’ gender, (3) and to examine differences across school years. Method: A quantitative research methodology with a cross-sectional design was employed. Data were collected through the Meaningful PE scale (a questionnaire designed to assess students’ perceptions of the eight features), where participants provided self-reported responses. The study involved 535 secondary education students, including 261 males (48.8%) and 274 females (51.2%), with an average age of 13.48 years (SD = 1.64). Participants were drawn from grades 8–12. First, descriptive and correlational analyses were performed. Then, demographic statistics and differences were calculated for the total sample, male and female participants. Findings: Results showed that the overall Meaningful PE scale showed strong positive correlations with features such as Fun (r =.88), Adaptive Teaching Style (r =.89), and Clarifying Teaching Style (r =.88). Motor Competence was linked with Challenge (r =.71) and Fun (r =.64). Social Interaction with the Teacher was strongly associated with Adaptive Teaching Style (r =.81) and Guiding Teaching Style (r =.83). Regarding differences based on gender, the global Meaningful PE score did not differ significantly, but Social Interaction with Peers (M = 4.60, SD = 1.10, p <.01), Personally Relevant Learning (M = 4.26, SD = 1.30, p =.02), Motor Competence (M = 4.80, SD = 1.12, p <.01) and Relief (M = 4.66, SD = 1.21, p =.03) were higher for males. Descriptive analyses revealed significant differences across the school years, but these differences did not follow a consistent pattern, suggesting that other contextual or individual factors may play a more influential role, for example class size ratio. Conclusion: In conclusion, teachers should consider the eight features of Meaningful PE (as reflected in the twelve factors analysed) when planning to promote a meaningful PE context. The observed gender differences highlighted the need for tailored pedagogical approaches that address specific barriers faced by female students and/or different age groups. © 2025 Association for Physical Education.},

Methods: Quantitative, correlational, cross-sectional study. 134 students participated (U). The Self-Directed Learning Scale (SDLR) of Fisher, Tague& King, the Academic Motivation Scale (AMS) and the socio-demographic questionnaire were used,to characterize the sample. The SPSS software is used to analyze the data. 0.19. Results: There was a statistically significant association between self-directed learning with: intrinsic motivation with stimulation of the experience towards achievement and knowledge, and with extrinsic motivation of identified regulation; and the demotivation had an inversely proportional association. Conclusions:The most self-determined students, that is, those with the highest intrinsic motivations, had the highest level of autonomy. © 2020, Fundacion Index. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose-The role of teacher autonomy support (TAS) is central to students' engagement. However, there is a scarcity of empirical evidence on the mediating role of personal best (PB) goals between autonomy support and student engagement. Hence, in this research we examined the extent to which TAS could impact cognitive, behavioural and emotional engagement with the mediating role of PB goals among undergraduate students. Methodology-A cross-sectional research design was applied. A total of 266 undergraduate students from a large government university located in northern Malaysia participated in this research. The Learning Climate Questionnaire (LCQ) and the Personal Best Scale were used to measure the students' perception of TAS and their PB goals respectively, while the Engagement Versus Disaffection with Learning measurement scale and the Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire were used to collect data on cognitive, behavioural and emotional engagement. Structural Equation Modelling using AMOS 23 was adopted to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings-The results of the study support our postulated model, showing that TAS is related with student engagement aspects through the full mediating role of PB goals. Significance-These results augment the present understanding of the self-determination theory motivation mediation model by highlighting that creating a conducive learning environment that facilitates self-determined behaviours among students will nurture PB goals and enhance engagement, which will be beneficial for teaching and learning processes in education. © Universiti Utara Malaysia Press.},
