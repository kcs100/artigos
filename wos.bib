Abstract = {Higher education has been actively encouraged to find more effective and
   flexible delivery models to provide all students with access to quality
   learning experiences yet also meet institutional imperatives for
   efficiency and accountability. Blended learning, commonly defined as an
   integration of traditional face-to-face and online approaches to
   instruction ( Garrison \& Kanuka, 2004; Graham, 2006; Macdonald, 2008),
   is now proposed as one solution that addresses both student learning and
   higher education organisational needs. Successful blended learning,
   however, is more than a simple integration of information and
   communication technologies with face-to-face approaches. This paper
   proposes, describes and evaluates a pedagogical approach to blended
   learning focused on learners and learning. First, we interrogate the
   literature related to blended learning to show how various constructions
   of blended learning may be driven by teacher-centric or learner-centric
   conceptions. Next, planning a learner-centric blended learning design
   for a core unit in a first year higher education course is described.
   The design is then evaluated using a mixed methodology in which the
   students' voices illuminate their experiences of blended learning unit
   design with regards to engagement, learning and self-determination.},

Abstract = {To diminish the digital divide in remote areas, the Ministry of
   Education in Taiwan initiates the I-Taiwan Projects, providing a digital
   tutoring program with the platform for synchronously teaching and
   learning. The program recruited and trained college and university
   students for online teaching of elementary and junior high school
   students living in remote towns and villages. Despite the great efforts
   devoted to recruiting and training, college students for online tutoring
   still have the difficulties in retention and persistence in the program.
   This research attempts to examine the factors influencing continuous
   intention towards using E-tutoring system, particularly focus on the
   roles of self-determined motivators, as well as social and technological
   influences. The extended Technology Accepted Model (TAM) was integrated
   with self-determination theory of motivation and social influences to
   develop the research model. Using a field survey of 119 college students
   participated in the Digital Tutoring Program, the results empirically
   validates the hypothesized relationships, indicating that enjoyment
   (intrinsic motivator) and social presence (social influence factor) were
   found to be the most important determinants of e-tutors' continuous
   intention towards using e-tutoring system. The results show that
   self-determined motivators and social influence factor were useful for
   predicting continuance intention of e-tutoring system. Findings may
   provide some practical implications for setting expectations for college
   students' online tutorials, and the needs for e-tutoring system
   development.},

Abstract = {In this study, we employ heutagogy (self-determined learning) to learn
   about autonomous learning characteristics of language MOOC learners
   using an embedded correlational mixed methods design. We administered
   quantitative and qualitative questionnaires to learners in two Italian
   language MOOCs offered by Wellesley College on the edX platform. We
   measured how four heutagogical attributes (self-efficacy,
   self-reflection, insight and internet skills) predict self-directed
   learning readiness in three different learner cohorts (high, moderate
   and low self-determined learners), and learners' capability level. We
   also discuss learners' preferred activity types for foreign language
   acquisition as revealed by the qualitative survey. We found that most
   learners are moderate or low self-determined learners and we observed
   statistically significant differences among the three groups in how the
   heutagogical attributes predict self-directed learning readiness.
   Moreover, learners showed a certain level of capability, and a
   preference for a relatively structured and traditional way of learning
   while, at the same time, expressing a need to improve their
   communicative competences.},

Abstract = {Mobile Heutagogy (M-Heutagogy) is the teaching practice that emphasizes
   self-determined learning and student autonomy. Many teachers and
   academicians have applied M-Heutagogy in their teaching and learning in
   Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The purpose of this study is to
   synthesize an empirical literature review of the M-Heutagogical practice
   among Higher Education students and its acceptance. The main objective
   of this paper is to review the literature on M-Heutagogy practice and
   its acceptance among Higher Education students. The researcher conducted
   a systematic review of 60 articles for the period 2007 to 2020. The
   findings indicate that M-Heutagogy has been applied in HEIs around the
   world with the support of emergent technologies and mobile applications.
   Unfortunately, only two M-Heutagogy acceptance studies have been done so
   far. Future research suggested that the M-Heutagogy acceptance model
   should be developed to be referred by researchers while doing an
   acceptance study.},

Abstract = {The term heutagogy was introduced by Hase and Kenyon in 2000 as the
   study of self-determined learning {[}1]. Its roots are in andragogy (the
   study of adult learning) although it goes beyond that when it places the
   focus on the learner and his or her development. The learner is
   responsible for the learning path, hence being able to decide not only
   on how but also on what to learn {[}1]. One of the key concepts
   underpinning heutagogy is capability. It is the ability to use the
   acquired capacity in novel situations as well as in familiar ones.
   Capability represents a key concept when it comes to educating future
   workforces for the 21st century complex and ever-changing workplace
   environments {[}1]. Flexibility, the ability for to quick change and
   rapid adaptation to new situations are at the kernel of efficacy and
   productivity in those domains {[}1]. Thus, there is a strong call for
   training models that create and develop capable lifelong learners.{[}1].
   Since MOOCs are destined to masses, they would be a great tool to
   achieve changes in the training process of learners quickly and in great
   dimensions. However, MOOCs have a poor reputation in education mainly
   due to their high dropout rates. Several difficulties of MOOCs have been
   identified in the literature, such as the lack of course structure, lack
   of skills in use of tools, and lack of social and teaching presence
   {[}2]. MOOCs, therefore require self-discipline and self-guidance in a
   rather intentional way when compared to other forms of training. It
   seems to be assumed that the learners who take MOOCs have all the skills
   that would allow them to learn efficiently in such an environment.
   However, for many participants, MOOCs are the very first experience in a
   context where their responsibility and their willingness to learn might
   be challenged. It is clear that there is a gap consisting of the lack of
   guidance on how to become an efficient learner in such a
   ``non-traditional{''} learning environment as a MOOC, which creates
   feelings of intimidation and abandonment {[}2]. The principles of
   heutagogy (self-determined learning) offers elements that may help the
   developers of MOOCs overcome the problems learners may have in learning
   in an unstructured system {[}1]. Heutagogy can flourish in a Web 2.0
   environment, and it has been proposed as a framework for distance
   education {[}1]. As part of Web 2.0. MOOCs inherently carry heutagogical
   principles in their design but those should be intentional, planned and
   intensified. The aim of this paper is to discuss ways in which MOOCs can
   become real heutagogical instances. This is part of a research project,
   the main objective of which is to identify the fundamental
   characteristics for an effective heutagogical MOOC (hMOOC) and to,
   consequently, create a framework for hMOOC.},

Abstract = {The Goal-Setting Challenge App (GSC App) translates the Self-Determined
   Learning Model of Instruction (SDLMI) to a web-based format, shifting
   responsibility from teachers to technology to address challenges in
   scaling-up implementation. The present descriptive study examines
   transition-age students' responses to GSC App lessons to explore the
   degree to which students' responses reflected learning aligned with the
   SDLMI. Student responses suggest the GSC App successfully supported
   students in progressing through the SDLMI and setting goals, building
   action plans, and evaluating their progress. Implications related to the
   importance of setting standards for engagement in the GSC App, further
   exploration of teacher roles in supporting students to engage with the
   GSC App, and the ongoing provision of teacher implementation supports
   are highlighted.},

Title = {May student-centered principles affect active learning and its
   counterpart? An empirical study of Indonesian curriculum implementation},
Journal = {SAGE OPEN},
Year = {2023},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Education 4.0 emphasizes the use of hybrid approaches in the learning
   process. The use of peeragogy, heutagogy, and cybergogy may engage
   students in the learning processes in which active learning plays a key
   role. This study aimed to examine the effect of the implementation of
   the Merdeka Curriculum on active learning practices and their
   relationships with hybrid activities based on hybrid learning
   approaches, and active learning counterparts of (1) self-regulated
   learning: (2) self-directed learning, and (3) self-determined learning.
   These relationships will be examined in Indonesian curriculum
   implementation in which student-centered principles are emphasized. A
   cross-sectional survey was conducted by collecting responses of
   vocational high school students on survey. The digital questionnaire was
   sent to 600 Indonesian students, of whom 555 completed it. The
   relationships among the constructs were examined using a structural
   equation modeling. The results showed that a curriculum emphasizing
   student-centered principles was fully mediated by active learning and
   hybrid activities to promote student self-regulated learning (SRL),
   self-determined learning (SDET), and self-directed learning (SDL).
   Active learning and hybrid activities directly affect students' SRL,
   SDET, and SDL, Three counterparts of active learning that form important
   parts of long-life learning. This model indicates that Indonesian
   curriculum implementation may encourage active learning and indirectly
   increase learner engagement, autonomy, and metacognitive development.},

Abstract = {This qualitative study identified the factors that contributed to the
   success experienced by students with learning disabilities in their
   first year of college. The primary factors that emerged from student
   interviews were their attitudes about higher education, and their
   personal attributes including motivation, maturity, and persistence.
   Additionally, students' adjustment to academic and campus life, and
   their use of supports and skills, such as college tutors, studying,
   managing time, and advocating for their needs were factors that led them
   to college persistence. Practical implications are proposed for
   secondary educators, postsecondary support staff and educators,
   students, and families.},

Abstract = {The study investigates the effectiveness of using social media, within a
   self-determined or personalised learning environment, to nurture
   proactive, creative, and communicative learners with high self-efficacy
   and autonomy. Research has shown that interactivity, collaboration,
   learner negotiation and personalisation enabled by Web 2.0 can spur
   developmental growth of communication skills. Using a quasi-experiment
   with pre- and post-tests involving 184 business students taking
   Effective Writing Skills, the study found that a self-determined,
   personalised learning environment resulted in students demonstrating
   higher levels of pro-activity, autonomy and creativity that contributed
   to the growth of communication capabilities, when compared to control
   groups. It was also noted that peer influence could significantly affect
   communication outcomes in a social media enhanced learning environment.
   This study is significant because it examines how communication skills
   can be developed through the educational use of social media. It also
   addresses the demand to produce graduates with strong communicative
   skills. The research outcomes of this study can inform pedagogical
   practice in preparing future-ready articulate graduates.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this multiphase mixed methods study was to apply Deci and
   Ryan's (1985) self-determination theory in an investigation of the
   relationships among students' need satisfaction, motivation, and
   achievement in synchronous hybrid learning environments (i.e.,
   simultaneously teaching on-campus and online students using
   webconferencing). The results from Survey 1 indicated that online
   students reported significantly lower levels of relatedness than their
   on-campus counterparts. Follow-up interviews were conducted with
   purposefully chosen students and faculty members. The findings suggested
   that four themes impact synchronous hybrid learning: peer relatedness,
   technology influence, instructor impact, and program structure. In vivo
   quotations were used to develop a scale to assess participants'
   self-efficacy of relatedness development. Survey 2 data indicated that
   the new scale had good psychometric quality and that students reported
   significantly greater levels of self-efficacy for relatedness
   development with classmates in their same attendance mode than with
   peers in the opposite format. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Preparing students for the complex and changing nature of the workforce
   has become an overriding objective within higher education. New
   pedagogies, which incorporate both informal and formal learning and
   support personalization of learning, are central to this objective.
   Educators are required to reassess the use of traditional pedagogies, as
   they attempt to foster development of skills and competencies for
   lifelong learning. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is a learning
   theory that addresses this need, giving students agency in determining
   what and how they learn. The theory is based in the principles of
   learner agency, capability and self-efficacy, reflection and
   metacognition, and non-linear learning, and when used with technology
   can be a powerful instructional approach for building students'
   self-directed and lifelong learning skills. A compelling example of this
   is the e-portfolio. As a platform and assessment tool, the e-portfolio
   spans the spectrum of lifelong learning, as well as encompasses both
   formal and informal learning of the individual learner and addresses
   critical aspects of learning and reflection, showcasing the learner's
   acquired skills and competencies. Based on successful cases in the
   literature, this article discusses the principles of heutagogy, the
   pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH continuum) and its application in
   online learning environments, and the use of the eportfolio in further
   cultivating and advancing self-determined learning. The article also
   offers recommendations for future practice and theory.},

Abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) technology can promote sustainable consumption and
   pro-environmental behaviour. However, few studies have examined the
   psychological mechanisms that promote sustainable purchase intention
   from the perspective of VR education. Based on the self-determined
   motivation theory and VR attributes, this study proposes and empirically
   examines the underlying mechanism of VR customer knowledge education on
   sustainable purchase intention. The results show that VR customer
   knowledge education has a positive effect on customers' sustainable
   product knowledge levels, and subsequently, on sustainable purchase
   intention through the two mediators of knowledge richness and
   usefulness. Additionally, customers' intrinsic (versus extrinsic)
   learning motivation leads to a higher sustainable knowledge enhancement
   effect. Nonetheless, this effect is moderated by customers' prior
   sustainable knowledge; customers with low (versus high) prior
   sustainable knowledge are more susceptible to the effects of VR customer
   knowledge education.},

Title = {The dynamic mix of heutagogy and technology: Preparing learners for
   lifelong learning},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1629-1645},

Abstract = {With the swift pivot to online learning, teachers and students have been
   forced to adopt a new way of teaching and learning, which has required
   students to become more self-directed in their learning. In addition,
   teachers are faced with the challenge of preparing students for the
   workforce and lifelong learning. One emerging approach for addressing
   both these challenges is that of heutagogy, or self-determined learning.
   This paper discusses the rising demand for lifelong learning skills and
   the role that heutagogy can play in supporting students in developing
   self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Specifically, the paper
   presents a case study of a higher education institution that has
   introduced heutagogy, using interviews with programme
   leaders/instructors to investigate how a college in Israel incorporated
   heutagogy into their master's education programmes. Case study results
   reveal that there are challenges in incorporating heutagogy (eg,
   difficulty for students in adopting the approach), but once adopted,
   students preferred learning in a self-determined way.
   Practitioner notes
   What is already known about this topic?
   Lifelong learning skills are critical to student employability, and
   there is a need for exploring new theories and approaches for developing
   these skills.
   The current pandemic has forced traditional learning into the online
   space, requiring more self-directed learning skills in learners.
   Heutagogy has been identified as a net-centric teaching and learning
   theory for online learning.
   What this paper adds
   Positions heutagogy for use in traditional and online classroom settings
   in order to develop learners' self-directed and lifelong learning
   skills.
   Explores the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum and its use as an
   instructional strategy.
   Presents a case study of a higher education institution that has
   implemented self-determined learning.
   Implications for practice and/or policy
   This study encourages further research into use of heutagogy for
   developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills.
   This study provides guidance for those who want to introduce
   self-determined learning into classroom settings.},

Abstract = {Pedagogical foundations exist for incorporating technology in
   instruction; however, these foundations have not kept pace with
   technology's evolution. Through the use of Information Communication
   Technologies (ICTs), students now can share content directed at external
   audiences, i.e., audiences other than the instructor. These audiences
   are referred to as authentic audiences as they are public-facing and
   exist outside of the classroom. The existing literature offers evidence
   of student satisfaction with assignments directed at appealing to
   external audiences, however, the literature provides no comprehensive
   pedagogical rationale for assignments directed at authentic audiences
   wherein the goals are self-determined. The authors discuss the theory of
   heutagogy, the study of self-determined learning, as an approach for
   assessing assignments that utilize ICTs and are directed at authentic
   audiences. Finally, the authors offer an approach for the assessment of
   these assignments, including a rubric.},

Abstract = {More and more students in higher education are working during their
   studies when ``anytime, anywhere{''} learning have added value for
   adults leaners {[}4]. The information and communication technology have
   been perceived as the solution to improve quality, reduce costs, and
   increase access {[}7] consequently universities are providing different
   multiform learning possibilities like collaborative study projects in
   the self-determining teams where students are working and learning
   together. In this study we describe Master students learning process in
   virtual teams in the Project Business course by using four phases of
   SECI model of knowledge creation. SECI model is applied to assess
   transforming students' individual tacit knowledge into explicit
   knowledge and enriching it to tacit knowledge again in the individual
   and the group level. {[}9]. In the paper is presented how the graduate
   students' learning process occur in a teamwork exercise. During the
   focal course in our study students are producing in teams essays about
   different project management perspectives during the four phases of SECI
   model. The essays are publish in essay collection.},

Abstract = {UK Higher Education (HE) changes are driven by political impetus,
   social, economic and technological forces to bring about a
   highly-skilled workforce. Healthcare education in particular benefits
   from the adoption of new innovative ways to learn how to manage
   patient-centred integrated care. The balance of simultaneous skill and
   knowledge acquisition, such as in Healthcare, renders independent
   digital learning an attractive proposition for Higher Education
   Institutions (HEls) and the National Health Service (NHS). Application
   of digital technology to support learning increases flexibility and
   accessibility, but raises other issues. Lack of Information,
   Communication and Technological (ICT) expertise among learners,
   insufficient or unreliable internet access, equipment failure, software
   compatibility, staff confidence in digital education and above all, a
   contemporary pedagogy harnessing the combined HE-Society experiences.
   This paper describes a socially immersive learning (SIL) pedagogy as a
   departure from existing ways of being. It has arisen because of a range
   of factors that have caused a more fluid and fragmented political,
   economic and social landscape affording individuals to develop a new
   skill set of connectivity and collaboration as their self-determined
   learning needs dictate. Decision-making processes are important, as many
   HEIs currently pay scant attention to teaching students `how to learn'
   within a particular pedagogy such as e-learning, Technology Enhanced
   Learning, Technology Enabled Learning, with the expectation that
   students will seamlessly adapt to a different mode of learning. HEI
   systems are predominately designed for on-campus students; hence
   information relates to location thus raising identity issues for the
   online learner. Systems thinking overlooks the lived experience of
   online teaching, and the time investment required. E-learning is often
   perceived as `geographically remote' and that the spatial remoteness of
   the tutor renders the relationship more distant, thereby overlooking the
   strong relational aspects that can exist in e-learning and online
   communities.
   In an increasingly connected world in which the graduates of the future
   will be required to work across disciplines on inter-connected
   collective `wicked' problems. Silo working in university departments
   must become permeable to enable collaboration, networking and collective
   decision making. These changes, accompanied by the rise in degree
   apprenticeships which relocate elements of learning off-campus and into
   the workplace and social spaces, present challenges and openings to
   create student-centric engagement, enhance student experience and new
   learning opportunities in contemporary higher education.
   The implications of this development are to move beyond education design
   that aligns to preconceived notions of how individuals learn in
   prescribed places and using existing familiar methods (curriculum,
   schemes of work, defined learning content, defined learning outcomes) to
   the changing role and identity of the teacher, learner and contexts and
   collaboration where learning occurs. This new approach has the potential
   to become a keystone in a social movement that readily crosses,
   physical, social, economic and political boundaries to develop learning
   and translate that into ways of impacting on society as a global
   citizen.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the factors that
   influence a learner's ability to be self-directed (Andragogy) and
   self-determined (Heutagogy) may influence the understanding and
   modelling of mobile learning adoption. Heutagogy is seen as a
   progression along a continuum of pedagogical approaches from pedagogy to
   andragogy to heutagogy, where learners need to progress from each with
   the aim of becoming highly autonomous and mature learners. Due to the
   nature of mobile technology, learning can be orientated towards the
   learner to support their needs. Learners are now better equipped to
   manage and control their own learning as learning can take place
   anywhere and anytime. However not all students possess the required
   traits, such as self-management, self-control and desire for learning,
   that signal that are ready for learning that is no longer teacher-lead
   and directed.
   The study examines the results of a survey (n = 446 students) assessing
   how the traits that indicate a readiness for learning that is
   self-directed and self-determined, can impact on students' perceptions
   and adoption of mobile learning. This model was tested using structural
   equation modelling. The findings showed that there was a strong
   association with the factors of self-management, self-control and desire
   for learning on the positive perception of mobile learning and adoption.
   The study reinforces the need for scaffolding and developing learners so
   that they are comfortable to succeed in an environment that is
   self-directed and determined.},

Abstract = {Most engineering and technology-focused program curricula are firmly
   fixated on the required technical skills to meet the profession's needs.
   However, in today's rapidly changing, globalized world, engineers and
   technologists need more than technical competencies to meet the
   requirements of their professional work. This work illustrates how the
   LinkedIn Learning (LiL) platform was used as a ``learning partner{''} to
   complement undergraduate engineering technology management courses to
   enrich reflective thinking and nudge lifelong learning tendencies. The
   rationale for integrating LiL into the course framework is examined,
   including study design and survey results. Summary research indicates
   that students appreciated the LiL coursework assignments. Most
   respondents perceived that the LiL courses increased their knowledge and
   skills in the subject matter presented. The study illustrated movement
   towards self-determined learning behaviour and improved reflective
   capabilities.},

Title = {Investigating the Effect of 3D Simulation-Based Learning on the
   Motivation and Performance of Engineering Students},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   Simulation-based Learning (SBL) was used in Machining Technology, a
   sixty-hour module for second year engineering students, at the School of
   Engineering at Temasek Polytechnic. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the effect of SBL on learners' motivation and performance.
   In assessing students' motivation, we adopted a framework based on the
   Self-determination Theory (SDT), chosen on account of its comprehensive
   treatment of the relationship between students' perceived needs
   satisfaction and their motivation.
   PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS)
   It is hypothesized that SBL, which provides learners with interactive
   learning experiences, will enhance students' motivation and performance.
   We explored the effect of SBL on students' perceived psychological needs
   satisfaction, motivation, and learning, and how SBL affected students'
   understanding and application of content knowledge.
   DESIGN/METHOD
   The intervention procedure involved the incorporation of SBL in
   Machining Technology, a 60 hour module in the mechanical engineering
   program. Survey findings and post-intervention assessment outcomes were
   used to assess the students' perceptions of their basic psychological
   needs satisfaction, motivation, and performance.
   RESULTS
   Our findings suggest that the students perceived their psychological
   needs to be satisfied and had high levels of self-determined motivation.
   Students who undertook SBL had higher mean performance test scores,
   although SBL may have differential effects on learners depending on
   factors such as gender, educational backgrounds, and IT knowledge.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Our findings suggest that the students perceived their basic
   psychological needs to be met and that SBL can potentially enhance
   self-determined motivation as well as improve learning in general.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, blended learning
   theory in higher education has become more and more maturing, many
   experts and scholars at home and abroad are interested in this field. In
   this paper, we selected the information economics course as the
   observation, and observed the students during the period from 2014 to
   2016,. In the experiment, some students learned in traditional class and
   the others learned in blended environment using Hstar teaching platform
   as the supporting tool every year. The results show that using Hstar
   teaching platform as blended learning tool made teaching and learning
   more effective. So we can conclude that Hstar teaching platform is an
   effective platform in blended learning in higher education.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine if and how the
   introduction of a flipped learning (FL) framework in Norwegian lower and
   upper secondary school physical education (PE) could affect student
   situational motivation and health-related fitness knowledge (HRFK). 206
   Norwegian students (48\% girls) from secondary and upper secondary
   schools were included in a three-week-long intervention. 85 students
   were assigned to an intervention group and 121 students to a control
   group, with the intervention aimed at integrating information
   communication technology (ICT) through the use of online videos. The
   results showed a negative motivational change for male students unless
   the activity changes were placed within an explanatory rationale through
   FL. The application of FL caused more cognitive knowledge learning,
   resulting in higher levels of HRFK among both girls and boys. The
   current research provided valuable insights into Norwegian students'
   motivation for PE and that cognitive knowledge learning can be affected
   when integrating the use of ICT in PE.},

Abstract = {In a globally interconnected, technological, increasingly ubiquitous
   context, fashion designers need to convert prospective information into
   meaningful, current and validated content that companies and
   professionals may quickly access and integrate into their practice.
   Fashion design thrives in multicultural, hyperconnected settings, where
   learning happens as new projects are being developed. Fashion design
   cannot be fostered within a rigid environment (professional or
   educational), that do not promote, constantly and permanently,
   experiences and knowledge exchanges. So, what kind of learning would
   foster autonomous, prospective, meaningful experiences in fashion
   design? What principles would be necessary to frame such kind of
   learning?
   This paper is part of a broader research about fashion design in higher
   education contexts, especially those offered online (distance learning)
   under a lifelong learning perspective, and for that reason it keeps
   certain premises that guided the study.
   Firstly, it is this paper perspective that, similarly to what happens in
   fashion design development in professional scenarios, fashion design
   education should prompt opportunities of contextualized collaboration
   among learners, that come from multiple backgrounds, without the
   limitation of time and space. Next, in order to establish a lifelong,
   collaborative and creative experience, a greater fluidity would be
   expected between the learning / professional environments, allowing the
   learner / professional to travel in both ways, at different moments of
   their lives, and the acquired knowledge (professionally or academically)
   would be properly recognized. It is not the purpose of this paper to
   advocate that this fluidity can be better achieved by either online,
   onsite, blended or mobile supported learning systems. This leads to the
   final premise. Although it seems important to deeply acknowledge and
   study the technological possibilities for learning, simply propose a new
   delivery method is not enough. A meaningful learning experience should
   contemplate fashion design specificities, meet different professional
   needs, be prepared for the demands and impermanence of the sector, and
   create broader learning opportunities. Therefore, in order to accomplish
   that, a valid set of principles must be firstly established, and this is
   the main purpose of this paper.
   One of the most important aspects of this study was to examine a
   theoretical perspective that could ground fashion design education, and
   in doing so, contemplated fashion as a complex, cross disciplinary
   phenomenon, that presents specificities (a global system of massive
   production and acceptance of clothes and styles for a certain period of
   time, which entails highly expected and constant demand for innovation
   and creativity, originality and prospective information) that needed to
   be contemplated when establishing a set of learning principles. After an
   exploratory study carried out on existing researches about fashion
   design education, a set of learning principles were structured under the
   Heutagogy approach, considered in this paper a promising theory, since
   it sustains a student-centred, self-determined, double-loop lifelong
   learning perspective. Finally, those principles were used to analyse
   previously selected fashion design higher education programs, offered
   online and recommendations are presented.},

Abstract = {Under a global scenario of constant changes and uncertainty, of
   technological immersiveness, that permeates every aspect of life,
   traditional education models, supported by fixed, transmission-mode,
   teacher-centered pedagogies cannot solely fulfill the demands of the
   professional or academic settings. It is indispensable to study new
   models of learning, as well as more beneficial forms of using
   technological environments, tools, resources to implement a learning
   experience based on collaboratives, on knowledge construction and
   sharing, on alternative, contextualized and valid ways of assessment.
   It is also necessary to rethink learning in fashion design since it
   requires constant development and renewal of competencies to meet the
   rapid changes of the professional landscape, as well as the individual
   needs. Fashion design presupposes, like any design process, a learning
   capability, since it starts (or restarts) every season, every cycle,
   with the recognition of a problem: the need or the desire for what is
   new, cultivated by the taste for innovation, creativity, different,
   unknown. So, in order to keep updated, fashion designers form a sort of
   `learning community', usually in online environments, around fashion
   information, ideas, resources, experiences, that are transmitted,
   shared, fed, promoted, redesigned, recreated or even admittedly copied.
   For this reason, it seemed necessary to examine alternative
   possibilities that foster collaborative online learning in fashion
   design.
   Part of broader research about fashion design in higher education
   contexts, this study presents a model for a fashion design collaborative
   online course structured on previously studied set of principles, and
   reinforced by Heutagogy, as the primary theoretical approach that
   emphasizes collaborative, contextualized, connected, constructive,
   lifelong, self-determining learning experiences.
   Although there is some debate whether learning in fashion design can
   happen in online environments, the main focus of this study was to
   establish a model for a fashion design collaborative online course based
   on a coherent theoretical structure, able to guide content, resource,
   delivery, assessment choices and to guarantee the learning quality. The
   model presented in this study is expected to enhance learning as a
   process, starting with interactions around a design problem and
   potentially evolving to form a learning community, virtually connected
   beyond the physical classrooms or the physical frontiers, stimulating
   innovative, meaningful and contextualized fashion design ideas and
   solutions.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {For transformation to occur in learning environments and for learners,
   higher education must first consider how such transformation will occur
   for the designers and facilitators of learning experiences: the
   university teachers or educators we call faculty (in the US),
   instructors, lecturers or professors or, in some instances, university
   staff. For the purpose of this article, we will refer to them as
   educators or faculty, and the process of their professional development
   as educational development or faculty development (more historically
   common in the US context). We aspire towards universities in the future
   that cultivate connected, participatory educational development that
   crosses institutional and national boundaries, and which takes equity,
   social justice and power differences into consideration, promoting
   educator agency. We propose theoretical underpinnings of our approach,
   while also highlighting some examples of recent practice that inspire
   this direction, but which are small in scale, and can provide
   springboards for future approaches that may be applied on a wider scale
   and become more fully integrated, supported and rewarded in
   institutions. Our theoretical underpinnings are influenced by theories
   of heutagogy and self-determined learning, transformative learning,
   connectivist and connected learning, and an interest in equity.We share
   models of alternative approaches to educator development that take
   advantage of the latest advances in technology, such as \#DigPINS,
   Virtually Connecting, collaborative annotation, and dual-pathway MOOCs.
   We then share a semi-fictional authoethnography of our (the authors')
   daily connected lives, and we end by highlighting elements of the models
   we shared that we feel could be adapted by institutions to achieve
   educator professional development that is more transformative,
   participatory, and equitable.},

Abstract = {A web based organic chemistry practice tool that increases active
   learning has been shown to result in improved student success in an
   organic chemistry course. Undergraduate level organic chemistry courses
   require students to solve different kinds of problems. Of these,
   students generally find multi-step synthesis to be the most challenging.
   We built an online practice environment that provides students with
   practice and guidance in solving multi-step synthesis problems. Student
   performance in multi-step synthesis problems in class assessments was
   collected and compared to website usage for organic chemistry classes in
   2011 and 2012.
   For both the 2011 and the 2012 classes, statistical analysis shows that
   website usage is connected to increased performance on multi-step
   synthesis problems. A covariate analysis was used to correct for other
   student-centric factors such as diligence and background knowledge. We
   also studied motivational factors that influence students' website usage
   and performance. Data was also collected that showed how the students
   interacted with the site, and their perceptions of its usefulness.
   Student website usage is found to be positively correlated with some
   motivational factors on particular, specifically self-determination.
   Engagement with the site and perceptions of its usefulness are also
   highest for students who are more self-determined.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates how psychological needs spurring self-determined
   motivation relate to collective efficacy for flourishing in online
   learning communities. Self-determination theory posits individuals
   experience intrinsic motivation to flourish at educational tasks because
   of targeted satisfaction of the three psychological needs: autonomy,
   relatedness, and competence. However, studies conducted to investigate
   collective, technology-assisted learning processes suggest competence
   and relatedness may play a pivotal role in online community engagement
   and knowledge-sharing. Moreover, informal gaming experiences may mirror
   the collaborative skills needed in online educational/professional
   communities. These insights suggest confidence in one's abilities to
   contribute to a community, the perception of a strong, supportive social
   culture in the online classroom, and informal online experiences may
   lead to self-determined motivation enabling agents in distributed,
   technology-assisted classrooms to collectively flourish. Little work has
   been done to examine effects of need satisfaction on collective efficacy
   in using online technologies. To fill this research gap, we used
   structural equation modelling to investigate perceptions of 636
   undergraduate students enrolled in classes within an education
   department at a midwestern university employing weekly asynchronous
   blogging. Our results suggest students' experience with multiplayer
   gaming, and need satisfaction towards competence and relatedness
   correlate with higher collective efficacy in technology-assisted
   classrooms employing discussion forums.},

Abstract = {Evaluation of learning and the development of prelicensure nursing
   education include an exploration of new teaching models and techniques
   for student learning assessment. The utilization of high-fidelity human
   simulation in nursing provides nursing faculty and students the
   opportunity to expand the boundaries of conventional learning from an
   instructional paradigm to a blending of modalities that enrich the
   student experience and provide an avenue for self-determined learning.
   The inception of computer-generated high-fidelity human simulation
   technology into the undergraduate nursing curriculum generated this
   correlation study, which examined two separate groups of senior
   baccalaureate nursing students' reported self-efficacy for providing
   family-centered care. This research examined each group of students'
   reported self-efficacy on the first day of the pediatric semester before
   and after simulation and on the last day of the pediatric semester
   before and after simulation. In addition, the relationship between two
   senior baccalaureate nursing student groups' reported self-efficacy at
   four data points was examined. The concluding data identified that
   senior baccalaureate nursing students have unrealistic self-assessments
   of their clinical knowledge and nursing performance capabilities before
   simulation scenario participation. The perceived ability of
   undergraduate students to self-identify their previously acquired
   knowledge and transferable clinical reasoning to family-centered
   situations is inaccurate. Human simulators are an effective teaching and
   learning modality in measuring factors that affect student outcomes.},

Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 30},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article was to explore, from the perspective of
   students and graduates with disabilities, the skills that are necessary
   to be self-determined at university, why these are important, and how
   they can be developed to remain in university and graduate successfully.
   A systematic review, including 16 qualitative studies with a total of
   303 participants, was carried out. The results provide information on:
   essential skills to facilitate self-determination and successful
   completion of university studies (problem-solving skills, learning about
   oneself, goal setting, self-management, self-advocacy) and attributes
   (autonomy, resilience, and empowerment); the reasons for being
   self-determined at university (achieving academic goals, overcoming
   barriers, demonstrating abilities, self-confidence, and academic
   success); and how self-determination can be learned at university (trial
   and error; family, faculty and peers; disability services; peers;
   specific programmes; and information technology communication). The
   conclusions are encouraging and show that self-determination can be
   learned in universities with the necessary supports.},

Abstract = {Web-based inquiry learning provides opportunities for students to take
   responsibility to regulate their learning. However, due to a lack of
   science inquiry-specific self-regulated learning (SRL) frameworks, there
   is insufficient understanding of SRL processes in inquiry-based science
   learning. This study aims to explore students' SRL patterns by using a
   comprehensive framework that combines SRL with the science inquiry
   process. Additionally, log-file data collected in the online science
   inquiry learning session were used to analyze students' SRL patterns.
   The results of the latent class analysis revealed four types of SRL
   learners: disengaged learners, proficient SRL learners, aimless
   reflective learners, and less reflective learners. Furthermore, we found
   significant differences in science achievement tests among different SRL
   learners. Specifically, proficient SRL learners and less reflective
   learners scored significantly higher than the other two types of
   learners. A difference was also found between proficient SRL learners
   and disengaged learners in terms of their self-determined motivation.
   Understanding the heterogeneity of SRL processes among students revealed
   from distinct SRL patterns informs how to provide targeted intervention
   and support for students who encounter difficulties in inquiry-based
   science learning.},

Title = {Master your practice! A quantitative analysis of Device and system
   handling training to enable competent interactions with intelligent
   voice assistants},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR REPORTS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Intelligent voice assistants (IVAs), such as Siri or Alexa, are
   voice-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems that help users solve
   everyday tasks using voice commands. Users often have a superficial
   understanding of the full range of functions IVAs can be used for and
   how to use them effectively. Since higher knowledge of device and system
   handling is fundamental for positive interaction quality and
   self-determined use of IVAs, this study examines how training can
   contribute to the promotion of variables such as usage aspects, social
   perception, and self-determined interaction and how such training can be
   designed. Based on an established competence framework and the
   principles of learning psychology and media didactics, three online
   training modules were developed to strengthen the user's device and
   system handling competence, and their effects on the parameters of
   competent AI interaction were investigated. A total of 110 students took
   part in the three training studies. Results of dependent t-tests show
   that completing training modules improves device and system handling and
   increases the intention to use IVAs more self-determined. In detail,
   participants perceive IVAs as more useful, tend to be more explorative
   and indulgent, feel more competent to use IVAs, and perceive them as
   less disturbing. Overall, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of
   training in improving the perceived usefulness of IVAs, exploratory and
   indulgent behavioral intentions, and decreasing the disturbance of IVAs.
   This work has great potential for research and education to improve,
   explore, and advance user behavior and competent interaction with IVAs,
   as well as for broader AI applications.},

Abstract = {Outreach science labs have been established as non-formal out-of-school
   learning environments in the fields of science, technology, engineering,
   and mathematics. Previous research has suggested that visiting an
   outreach science lab can be beneficial in terms of student motivation.
   Nevertheless, the current research on these out-of-school learning
   environments lacks studies that investigate important variables for the
   development of self-determined student motivation, such as perceived
   competence. In our study, we investigated the moderating effect of the
   learning environment on the relationship between students' contextual
   competence perceptions and their situational competence experiences
   regarding experimentation. For this purpose, 119 students in the first
   year of the upper secondary school participated in an experimental
   course on enzymology at an outreach science lab (n = 60) and in their
   biology classroom at school (n = 59). Our results showed that the
   relationship between students' contextual competence perceptions and
   their situational competence experiences during experimentation is
   moderated by the learning environment. The analyses revealed that
   students with a higher contextual competence perception showed
   comparable situational experiences of competence in both learning
   environments. In contrast, the students who perceived themselves as less
   competent at a contextual level benefited from experimenting at the
   outreach science lab in terms of their situational competence
   experiences.},

Abstract = {The goal of this research was to explore cognitive, self-determined
   learning and autonomous motivational effects in the context of a mobile
   science exhibition (N=256) in Finland. The pupils were sixth-graders
   with an average age of 12 years 6 months. Autonomy experience, as
   measured by the Relative Autonomy Index (RAI), had an effect on how the
   pupils liked learning science both at school and in a science centre
   context. The more autonomous that students feel, the more likely it is
   that they have intrinsic motivation in learning science. The RAI also
   predicted momentary situational motivation. The most important enhancer
   of situation motivation was liking science learning at school, but this
   was true only among boys; nevertheless, in general, girls were somewhat
   more motivated by the science exhibition than boys. There was no gap
   between boys and girls in post-knowledge testing, suggesting that girls
   benefitted more from the science centre learning experience than boys.
   Although gender differences in the knowledge tests leveled, students
   having higher reasoning ability, measured by Raven, gained more from the
   exhibition than the others. Post-knowledge was explained most by
   pre-knowledge, but the overall substantial learning results were
   enhanced directly and indirectly by the motivational factors. The
   practical implication for the science centres is to offer both teachers
   and pupils learning materials to be used before and after the visits.},

Abstract = {The gender digital divide (GDD) is a social phenomenon that denies
   citizens access to technologies, the internet, and the services
   associated with Education 4.0. Reducing this gap requires communicative
   literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to
   create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual
   environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that
   focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological
   world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical
   principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which
   emphasize the use of technology, self -determined learning, and
   collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the
   participation of 124 Mexican students of technical -professional
   education. The study's objective was to analyze how they scaled their
   communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative
   experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in
   digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico.
   Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic
   thinking (z = -2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly
   higher mean ( M = 25.36) than men ( M = 25.11). Qualitative results
   support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as
   participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90\%).
   This suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively
   enhance communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they
   can be spaces where both women and men achieve similar levels of digital
   literacy.},

Title = {Supporting Undergraduate STEMM Education: Perspectives from Faculty
   Mentors and Learning Assistants in Calculus II},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In higher education, Learning Assistants (LAs)-a relatively recent
   evolution grounded in peer mentorship models-are gaining popularity in
   classrooms as universities strive to meet the needs of undergraduate
   learners. Unlike Teaching Assistants, LAs are undergraduate students who
   receive continuous training from faculty mentors in content-area
   coaching and pedagogical skills. As near-peers, they assist assigned
   groups of undergraduates (students) during class. Research on LAs
   suggests that they are significant in mitigating high
   Drop-Fail-Withdrawal rates of large enrollment undergraduate science,
   technology, engineering, mathematics, and medical (STEMM) courses.
   However, there is a dearth of description regarding the learning between
   LAs and STEMM faculty mentors. This paper reports on perspectives of
   faculty mentors and their cooperating LAs in regard to their learning
   relationships during a Calculus II at a research-oriented university
   during Spring of 2020. Using an exploratory-descriptive qualitative
   design, faculty (oral responses) and LAs (written responses) reflected
   on their relationship. Content analysis (coding) resulted in four
   salient categories (by faculty and LA percentages, respectively) in:
   Showing Care and Fostering Relationships (47\%, 23\%); Honing
   Pedagogical Skills (27\%, 36\%); Being Prepared for Class and Students
   (23\%, 28\%); and Developing Content Knowledge in Calculus (3\%, 13\%).
   Benefits of LAs to faculty and ways to commence LA programs at
   institutions are also discussed.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, blended learning
   as a worldwide hot topic in the field of education has attracted
   domestic and foreign researchers' attention including academic
   organizations, practitioners and education managers. In view of the
   shortage of the low efficiency in traditional offline learning due to
   the limitation of time and space, a novel application which contains
   offline learning and online learning was proposed. In our study, we
   selected the teaching of software engineering course and used starC as
   the supporting tool. Through analyzing learning behavior we found that
   students have higher learning enthusiasm and participation on blended
   learning than that on traditional offline learning. We can foresee that
   blended learning has a broad application prospect and huge development
   potential in the education.},

Abstract = {The present study examined motivation toward English learning among
   students at an international school in Japan. The motivation of 112
   elementary school students, including those with English and Japanese as
   an L1, and those bilingual in English and Japanese, was analyzed based
   on self-determination theory. The results showed a distinction between
   intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, including three types of regulation
   (viz., identified, introjected, and external regulation) on the
   self-determination continuum. For all three language groups,
   self-determined orientations constituted the highest motivation for
   studying English, and English L1 participants were more enthusiastic
   than Japanese L1 participants about studying English. Whereas a number
   of studies have suggested that Japanese L1 students' motivation toward
   English learning decreases with grade level, this study found that
   participants' intrinsic motivation did not decrease significantly. This
   finding may be due to the immersion environment, in which Japanese L1
   participants learnt English together with English L1 participants, whose
   intrinsic motivation significantly increased from the middle to upper
   grades. It may also be due to the opportunity to use English with both
   L1 and L2 peers, allowing L2 learners to visualize target language use
   in the English-Japanese immersion environment.},

Title = {A review of recent research in EFL motivation: Research trends, emerging
   methodologies, and diversity of researched populations},
Journal = {SYSTEM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {103},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The increasing interest in English as a foreign language (EFL) across
   the globe has necessitated learning opportunities that engage and
   sustain students' motivation to learn English. This paper aims to
   provide an analysis of trends in EFL motivation between 2016 and 2020.
   While examining 90 studies published during this time frame, we have
   focused on an overview of methodologies, theories, and backgrounds of
   researched populations. We have also aimed to summarize the key findings
   of the literature in order to discuss the emergent themes in current EFL
   motivation research. Hence, this paper offers a comprehensive analysis
   and synthesis of recent EFL motivation research trends. Although 24
   countries and economies were represented, many studies came from Taiwan
   and China. Furthermore, most of the studies featured socioeconomically
   privileged students and students at the higher levels of education, with
   few mentions of disadvantaged populations. We found extensive use of
   technology, through which we can identify a viable path for enhancing
   language learning, teaching, and future research. This review highlights
   the need for sustainable interventions and studies with diverse
   populations in the expanding field of EFL.},

Abstract = {This paper summarizes the experience of training foreign students at the
   pre-university courses using the technology of the activity-based
   teaching method as a special didactic system. The object of the study is
   foreign students entering the engineering majors of the university after
   graduating from the pre-university courses. To activate the process of
   teaching the future studying foreign language, as well as teaching
   introductory core subjects (for the further studying on bachelor and
   master degree programs), teachers of the pre-university courses began to
   actively use activity-based teaching methods. The essence of
   activity-based teaching method is that the student becomes a subject of
   activity and doesn't receive knowledge from others, but develop it by
   himself in the process of his own educational and cognitive activity. At
   the same time, he learns to self-determine, to be involved in learning
   process, to solve arising difficulties, to make independent discoveries,
   to analyze and evaluate his activities by himself. The implementation of
   our project has demonstrated that using of activity-based methods and
   technologies made it possible to develop a cognitive motivation of
   foreign students to learn foreign language, including for the future
   professional communication and further studying on bachelor degree
   programs. As a research and practical experience have shown, the
   activity-based method forms and develops the necessary components of
   students' personal development and readiness to study on the higher
   education programs: creativity (creative abilities); critical, divergent
   and productive thinking; research skills; social intelligence, etc.
   After graduating the pre-university courses, students show independence
   in the knowledge development, activity and interest in learning
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Online learning engagement detection is a fundamental problem in
   educational information technology. Efficient detection of students'
   learning situations can provide information to teachers to help them
   identify students having trouble in real time. To improve the accuracy
   of learning engagement detection, we have collected two aspects of
   students' behavior data: face data (using adaptive weighted Local Gray
   Code Patterns for facial expression recognition) and mouse interaction.
   In this article, we propose a novel learning engagement detection
   algorithm based on the collected data (students' behavior), which come
   from the cameras and the mouse in the online learning environment. The
   cameras were utilized to capture students' face images, while the mouse
   movement data were captured simultaneously. In the process of image data
   labeling, we built two datasets for classifier training and testing. One
   took the mouse movement data as a reference, while the other did not. We
   performed experiments on two datasets using several methods and found
   that the classifier trained by the former dataset had a better
   performance, and its recognition rate is higher than that of the latter
   one (94.60\% vs. 91.51\%).},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of
   blended learning and traditional learning on students' learning
   achievements and academic press. A quasi-experiment study was conducted
   using a sample of 104 sophomores in a university in central China for
   three months. While students in the experimental group employed the
   blended learning approach, students in the control group employed the
   traditional learning approach. Students' pre- and post-tests and surveys
   showed that the students with the blended learning approach had a higher
   achievement in the pedagogy basis course than did the students with the
   traditional learning approach, while no significant difference was found
   on students' academic press between the two approaches. Further analysis
   showed there was a statistically significant relationship between
   students' learning achievements and academic press. The discussion and
   conclusion were included.},

Abstract = {Blended learning has caused comprehensive attention for domestic and
   foreign researchers with the rapid development of information technology
   and the theory of lifelong learning. In view of the inevitable
   shortcomings of traditional offline teaching and e-learning, an
   exploration of blended teaching pattern based on Hstar teaching platform
   and smart classroom is proposed which is a new education idea. In this
   paper, we select software engineering course and use Hstar teaching
   platform and smart classroom as the supporting environment, where
   students are allowed to choose the learning content according to their
   own plans and interests. Then we implement the blended formative
   evaluation method to evaluate learning effect and find that blended
   teaching pattern can break through the limitations of traditional
   education and e-learning. So we can forecast that blended learning will
   have a wide range of application and huge development potential in
   education.},

Abstract = {Mobile augmented reality (AR) technology creates realistic learning
   situations and a strong sense of immersion, which is conducive to
   enhance learning experience and stimulate learning motivation. However,
   existing mobile outdoor augmented reality applications generally have a
   complicated operation process and a mismatch between learning resources
   and corresponding scenes, which leads to a poor learning experience.
   Therefore, we propose a lightweight mobile outdoor AR method that
   combines deep learning and knowledge modeling to perceive learning
   scenes with a goal to improve learning experience. This method improves
   the accuracy of scene perception and resources retrieval and provides a
   convenient mobile AR technology solution for outdoor learning. To
   evaluate the proposed method, we provide objective criteria to assess
   the effectiveness of the lightweight object detection model and the
   learning resources retrieval approach. Simultaneously, we investigate
   the evaluation of participants majoring in teacher education on the
   usability of the proposed method by the modified system usability scale
   questionnaire and net promoter score. Experimental results demonstrate
   that our method achieves high detection accuracy, good usability, and is
   of great significance to improve outdoor learning experience.},

Abstract = {Recently, blended learning has attracted more and more attention by the
   educational researchers. They often focus on how to combine blended
   learning with advanced technology to serve the teaching. In this paper,
   we proposed a novel learning pattern of ``blended plus flipped{''}. The
   pattern combined blended learning with flipped classroom, which
   integrated with offline learning, online learning, and study in class
   and out of class,. This achieves seamless integration of time and space.
   We test this idea using the course of ``Educational Technology Research
   Method{''} and the experimental result demonstrates that blended
   learning pattern outperforms the traditional learning pattern. It is
   found that the time length of online learning and the active degree of
   the forum are the major factors affecting the blended learning pattern.},

Abstract = {With the development of blended learning, it has been widely applied in
   teaching process. However, in the context of blended learning, tutor are
   not easy to acquire learning process of students and to make good use of
   learner' behaviors records. Therefore, they cannot timely receive
   feedback and effectively perform evaluation based on traditional
   indicators and method. To address this problem, this paper applies
   learning analytics and studies the learning behavior records in blended
   learning, i.e., integrating learning analytics to construct an
   evaluation mode through the evaluation theory, types, subject, and
   applies the mode to the specific teaching practice. This can provide
   guidance for tutors and help them make better effective and objective
   evaluation.},

Abstract = {High school is the key period of the formation of student information
   literacy, reasonable and scientific evaluation of learners' information
   literacy is essential. According to the evaluation index system of
   domestic information literacy is not perfect, the phenomenon of more
   traditional evaluation methods, through literature research, expert
   consultation and practice research, the study developed the index
   assessment of information literacy of high school students, designed and
   developed the system of information literacy assessment in senior high
   school students to realize the data acquisition online and the results
   of visualization. Also, the system can show the different views of the
   index and score ranking from the dimensions of county, school, grade,
   class and gender. The practice result showed that the system could meet
   the requirements of the information literacy assessment, make positive
   effects on the students' information literacy level, and provide
   effective decision-making support for the department of education.},

Abstract = {Recently, blending learning has attracted more and more researchers
   attention in the field of teaching and learning. However, there are many
   troubles in making it clear as teaching model is suitable for specific
   knowledge points and there are no fixed implementing pattern. In this
   paper, we propose a new teaching strategy for blending learning, and
   divide all the knowledge into five categories, such as declarative
   knowledge, concept knowledge, rule knowledge, basic skill knowledge, and
   problem solving knowledge. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics
   of each category and predict which teaching model is suitable for a
   specific category. Then we have carried out the proposed teaching
   strategy on the geography course in senior high school. Experimental
   results demonstrate that the proposed strategy has the great
   significance in educational theory and practical application.},

Title = {Generating metadata to study and teach about African issues},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& PEOPLE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {341-365},
Abstract = {Purpose - After almost three centuries of employing western educational
   approaches, many African societies are still characterized by low
   western literacy rates, civil conflicts, and underdevelopment. It is
   obvious that these western educational paradigms, which are not
   indigenous to Africans, have done relatively little good for Africans.
   Thus, the purpose of this paper is to argue that the salvation for
   Africans hinges upon employing indigenous African educational paradigms
   which can be subsumed under the rubric of ubuntugogy, which the authors
   define as the art and science of teaching and learning undergirded by
   humanity toward others.
   Design/methodology/approach - Therefore, ubuntugogy transcends pedagogy
   (the art and science of teaching), andragogy (the art and science of
   helping adults learn), ergonagy (the art and science of helping people
   learn to work), and heutagogy (the study of self-determined learning).
   That many great African minds, realizing the debilitating effects of the
   western educational systems that have been forced upon Africans, have
   called for different approaches.
   Findings - One of the biggest challenges for studying and teaching about
   Africa in Africa at the higher education level, however, is the paucity
   of published material. Automated generation of metadata is one way of
   mining massive data sets to compensate for this shortcoming.
   Originality/value - Thus, the authors address the following major
   research question in this paper: What is automated generation of
   metadata and how can the technique be employed from an African-centered
   perspective? After addressing this question, conclusions and
   recommendations are offered.},

Abstract = {With the continuous development of online learning platforms,
   educational data analytics and prediction have become a promising
   research field, which are helpful for the development of personalized
   learning system. However, the indicator's selection process does not
   combine with the whole learning process, which may affect the accuracy
   of prediction results. In this paper, we induce 19 behavior indicators
   in the online learning platform, proposing a student performance
   prediction model which combines with the whole learning process. The
   model consists of four parts: data collection and pre-processing,
   learning behavior analytics, algorithm model building and prediction.
   Moreover, we apply an optimized Logistic Regression algorithm, taking a
   case to analyze students' behavior and to predict their performance.
   Experimental results demonstrate that these eigenvalues can effectively
   predict whether a student was probably to have an excellent grade.},

Abstract = {Due to the influence of psychology and cognitive science, personalized
   learning has gradually drawn the attention of many researchers. The
   purpose of this paper is to research an acceptable personalized learning
   method for learners. In this paper, we perform a study by literature
   review from four aspects. Firstly, we construct learner model based on
   learner's learning style and cognitive ability. Then, we introduce the
   process of personalized learning in online learning environment.
   Moreover, we propose the way of information presentation by knowledge
   visualization, and pose corresponding intervention strategies for
   different learning stages. Finally, we conduct experiments, and prove
   that the personalized learning method is more effective than the
   conventional learning method.},

Abstract = {Java language course is a professional course of computer science.
   Usually, the teacher encounters how to give learners insights into the
   language grammatical structure and how to find a proper way to help
   learners grasp a new kind of skill. To address this problem, learners'
   learning styles and competences should be focused on. In this paper, we
   propose a new Java language teaching scheme based on the learners'
   learning styles and competences. Furthermore, we develop a new learner
   model which is the core of the proposed adaptive learning system. The
   system was developed for Java language teaching and we implemented an
   experiment to identify its effectiveness. The experimental result shows
   that learners' ability of solving practical application problems and the
   enthusiasm of learning Java language have been significantly improved.
   Teachers can also be accurate and objective in the evaluation of
   learners' learning.},

Abstract = {Aiming at the existing problems of high labor cost, huge training data
   and long detection period for Identification technology of cotton flax
   fiber, which is based on textural feature and convolutional neural
   network (CNN) method. In this paper, it proposed a cotton and flax fiber
   detection method based on transfer learning. According to sharing the
   weight parameters of the convolutional layer and the pooling layer, the
   model hyperparameters can be adjusted for the new network to achieve
   high detection accuracy. The experimental results show that the
   detection accuracy of cotton flax fiber obtained by transfer learning is
   up to 97.3\%, the sensitivity is 96.7\%, and the specificity is 98.2\%.
   Compared with traditional machines, transfer learning method have large
   increase in the three indicators. Furthermore, the transfer learning
   method has shorter training time and fewer data sets.},

Abstract = {Taking photos by mobile phones has become an indispensable part of
   people's daily life with the popularity of smartphones. However
   professional photography content is also needed for taking high-quality
   photos by mobile phones as ones taken by professional cameras. Existing
   learning tools for photography can't provide photographic practice while
   presenting theoretical content, nor give real-time photography guidance
   according to the environment. Mobile augmented reality (AR) technology
   provides a new way to solve these problems by creating a real learning
   situation. Therefore, an innovative AR-based mobile photography
   application (ARMPA) is designed and developed as a method to connect
   theory and practice. Based on Learning-by-Doing instructional strategy,
   the ARMPA can timely and synchronously display the theoretical content
   of photography in the form of text and images corresponding to learners'
   practical operation. Moreover, it can provide learners real-time
   interaction and guidance by using AR environment sensing technology. The
   effect of ARMPA on learning gain and cognitive load is assessed by
   traditional methods of pre/post-test and questionnaires. To objectively
   explore the effectiveness of ARMPA from a cognitive and emotional
   perspective, we measure and extract four emotional state indexes of
   electroencephalogram (EEG) including engagement (ENG), relaxation (MED),
   interest (INT) and focus (FOC). Compared to traditional two-dimension (2
   D) application (APP), ARMPA improves learners' learning gains, decreases
   learners' cognitive loads. The participants in the AR group achieve
   better emotional states than those in the 2 D group. This study provides
   some empirical evidence for AR technology to boost mobile phone
   photography.},

Abstract = {High school statistical graph classification is one of the key steps in
   intelligent mathematics problem solving system. In this paper, a
   hierarchial classification method is proposed for high school
   statistical graph classification. Firstly, the dense Scale-invariant
   Feature Transform (SIFT) features of the input images are extracted.
   Secondly, the sparse coding of the SIFT features are obtained. Thirdly,
   these sparse features are pooled in multiscale. Finally, these pooled
   features are concatenated and then fed into single-hidden layer
   feedforward neural network for classification. The effectiveness of the
   proposed method is demonstrated on the constructed dataset, which
   contains 400 statistical graphs. In contrast to several state-of-the-art
   methods, the proposed method achieves better performance in terms of
   classification accuracy, especially when the size of the training
   samples is small.},

Abstract = {Magnetic field is an important knowledge point in junior high school
   physics discipline. Due to its invisible feature, students require to
   concretely perceive the magnetic field through experiments. However, the
   traditional experiment has some defects such as inconvenient operation
   and insignificant effect. Computer simulation technologies can solve
   these problems by virtualizing them, but it currently has some
   shortcoming in terms of its experience and credibility. Based on
   augmented reality technology and the idea of inquiry learning, this
   paper designs and implements an AR courseware for magnetic field
   teaching. The experimental experience is enhanced by the fusion of
   virtual and real while visualizing the magnetic line. Finally, a

   assigned randomly to one of two instructional conditions: interactive

   that the students who use the ICEP have better performance in learning

Abstract = {Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral imaging is a valuable tool
   for rapid identification of the real/fake human face in a single
   spectral image. However, it often suffers from the problems of band
   overlap and random noise. In this work, we have developed a spectral
   resolution enhancement algorithm via the contourlet transforms
   regularization for FTIR spectral imaging. First, we apply the contourlet
   transform to the observed FTIR spectrum and the ground-truth one, and
   compare their distributions of the contourlet coefficients. It shows
   that the distribution of the ground-truth spectrum is sparser than that
   of the observed one. Then, an infrared spectral resolution enhancement
   model is built to regularize the distribution of the observed FTIR
   spectrum by total variation regularization. Furthermore, an alternating
   scheme is exploited to estimate the instrument function and the latent
   FTIR spectrum, and it shows excellent convergence and stability.
   Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in
   suppressing random noise and preserving spectral details in the FTIR
   spectral resolution enhancement problems. Thus, the proposed method
   leads the high-resolution FTIR spectrum as a more efficient tool for the
   recognition of teacher's facial expressions in the intelligent learning
   environment.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of a new round of digital technology has changed
   traditional teaching and education methods. As the reserve force of
   future teachers, the development and cultivation of digital literacy of
   student teachers is an inevitable requirement for building a
   high-quality teacher team and cultivating excellent digital talents in
   the digital era. The purpose of this study was to explore the overall
   development status of digital literacy among student teachers in central
   China, and the differences in digital literacy levels among student
   teachers under different characteristic backgrounds. The results showed
   that the digital literacy level of student teachers is in the upper
   middle level, and there are significant differences in digital literacy
   among student teachers with different genders, grades, and degree types.
   This finding is beneficial for promoting the balanced and effective
   development of student teachers' digital literacy.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of MOOC platform, MOOC resource
   recommendation technology is emerging to improve the learner's learning
   efficiency. The traditional collaborative filtering resource
   recommendation technique is ineffective when dealing with sparse data
   and cannot accurately handle the high dimension attributes of online
   learning users, which result in low efficiency of resource
   recommendation. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a
   personalized recommendation system based on DBN in MOOC environment,
   which utilizes the high performance of DBN in function approximation,
   feature extraction, prediction classification and other aspects. It
   combines MOOC platform user - course feature vector to mine the user's
   course interests. Meanwhile, it uses the score of courses as the class
   label of DBN supervised learning. Through unsupervised pre-training and
   supervised feedback fine-tuning, the DBN recommendation model training
   can be achieved. The experiment was carried out in the real MOOC
   platform ``starc{''}, and was compared with several traditional
   recommendation methods. The experimental results show that the DBNCF is
   more efficient than the traditional cooperative filtering method.},

Abstract = {Aiming at the dimensional disaster and data imbalance in large-scale
   fabrics data, this paper proposes a classification method of fabrics
   images based on feature fusion and feature selection. The model of
   representation learning using transfer learning idea was firstly
   established to extract semantic features from fabrics images. Then, the
   features generated from the different models were cascaded on the
   purpose of features complement. Furthermore, the extremely randomised
   trees (Extra-Trees) were used to analyse the importance of the cascaded
   representation and reduce the computation time of the classification
   model with big data and high-dimensional representation. Finally, the
   multilayer perceptron completed the classification of selected features.
   Experimental results demonstrate that the method can detect fabrics with
   high accuracy. Moreover, feature importance analysis effectively
   accelerates the detection speed when the model processes big data.},

Abstract = {Early childhood English teaching has become a hot topic with the
   development of informatization and economic globalization, which
   deserves the urgent attention of schools, teachers and parents. After
   analyzing the current status of early childhood English teaching, we
   found several problems including difficulty in inspiring children's
   learning interest, lack of teaching situation, and low study efficiency.
   This paper proposes a new method for teaching early childhood English by
   designing augmented reality (AR) resources based on Situational Theory.
   Then, we build an English teaching mobile app with AR technology that
   teaches words and tests progress in early childhood at different ages,
   which can achieve excellent application effectiveness.},

Abstract = {While the use of experiments is important for developing students'
   scientific knowledge and skills, challenges may arise when teachers and
   students are conducting experiments in class, such as non-reusable
   experimental resources, safety issues and difficulties simulating some
   specific effects. Augmented reality (AR) technology affords an
   alternative approach to conducting experiments by bringing students a
   virtual-real mixed learning environment. In this study, taking junior
   high school physics knowledge on the magnetic field as an example, we
   designed and developed an AR-based mobile simulated experiment tool.
   This study investigates the effect of the AR-based experiment on
   students' knowledge improvement and cognitive load compared with 3D and
   traditional experiments. A sample of 122 ninth-grade students was
   randomly chosen and assigned to three groups (AR, 3D and Traditional).
   The results demonstrate that students in the AR group performed better
   than those in the 3D and Traditional groups in terms of their knowledge
   improvement. The AR group students also experienced the lowest cognitive
   load among the three groups. Moreover, students had positive perceptions
   about AR and 3D tools. The implications of this study are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we developed a hand gesture recognition technology in a
   human-computer interaction system with several hand gestures. The
   proposed system can help teacher to control the multi-screen touchable
   teaching tools, such as sweeping right or left to access the previous or
   next slide, with a fist to call the eraser tool to rub out the wrong
   content. To verify its efficiency and other qualities, we conducted a
   quasi-experiment in our program site in east part of China which
   analyzed the pre- and post-test scores in Math class of each
   experimental groups. Moreover, the error recognition rate is reduced by
   increasing the relevant features and threshold training for the teaching
   application. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system
   achieves the high accuracy and real-time performance.},

Abstract = {Tujia brocade (Xi lan ka pu) is a kind of traditional handcraft brocade
   which was listed in the first batch of non-material cultural heritage of
   China. It has become a popular trend to promote non-material cultural
   heritage with digital technology. Personalization recommendation for
   Tujia brocade culture resources could push new knowledge and something
   the user interested in, which could improve the efficiency of knowledge
   searching. The purpose of this paper is to realize personalization
   recommendation of Tujia brocade culture resources via using the hybrid
   recommendation technology, which was combined collaborative filtering
   with content filtering. Initially, we establish a set of basic culture
   resource databases for Tujia brocade, including user information
   database, preference pattern database, and build the user model and
   resource model. We then match the user preferences and the specific
   characteristics of Tujia brocade cultural resources through the
   description of resource characteristic. We finally choose the resources
   with high similarity and recommends to users, so as to realize the
   personalized recommendation for Tujia brocade culture resources.},

Abstract = {SPOC forums are the main vehicle for learners to communicate and
   interact online. Learners are able to conduct group knowledge
   construction through collaborative discussions; thus a large amount of
   text data are generated. These data often reflect learners' implicit
   cognitive behaviors. This study aimed to explore the development
   trajectory of group cognitive behaviors in a SPOC forum among learners,
   and to further uncover the behavioral regularity that learners'
   cognitive behavior may subsequently shift and change over time.
   Specifically, we collected 35 participants' forum data across 14 weeks.
   Lag sequential analysis and epistemic network analysis were jointly
   adopted to discover cognitive behavior sequence and the connection
   structure between cognitive behaviors in different learning stages. As
   discussion progressed in the forum, behavior sequence had the tendency
   of diversity and the change of cognitive behavior structure was
   significant. Especially in the final stage, learners' cognitive
   behaviors gradually shift to lower-order cognitive behaviors, which may
   be related to preparation for exams. Therefore, teacher could rethink
   the design of discussion content and examination style to maintain a
   relatively high level of cognitive engagement in forum discussion.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to examine the role and process of reflective
   assessment supported by the Knowledge Connections Analyzer in helping
   low academic achievers to develop epistemic agency in knowledge
   building. The participants were 33 ninth-grade low achievers from a
   visual arts course in Hong Kong. A comparison class of 33 students,
   taught by the same teacher and studying the same topics in a regular
   knowledge-building environment, also participated. Qualitative tracing
   of students' online discourse showed that reflective assessment can help
   low achievers develop high-level epistemic agency. Qualitative analysis
   of the students' prompt sheets revealed that reflective assessment
   encouraged low achievers to set knowledge-building goals, collectively
   and continuously analyse and reflect on their inquiry and ideas, and
   generate actions to address identified gaps, thus helping them engage in
   high-level epistemic agency. The study results have important
   implications for designing technology-rich environments that support
   learners and offer insights into how teachers can help learners develop
   epistemic agency.},

Abstract = {In recent years, network traffic data have become larger and more
   complex, leading to higher possibilities of network intrusion.
   Traditional intrusion detection methods face difficulty in processing
   high-speed network data and cannot detect currently unknown attacks.
   Therefore, this paper proposes a network attack detection method
   combining a flow calculation and deep learning. The method consists of
   two parts: a real-time detection algorithm based on flow calculations
   and frequent patterns and a classification algorithm based on the deep
   belief network and support vector machine \&\#x0028 DBN-SVM \&\#x0029 .
   Sliding window \&\#x0028 SW \&\#x0029 stream data processing enables
   real-time detection, and the DBN-SVM algorithm can improve
   classification accuracy. Finally, to verify the proposed method, a
   system is implemented. Based on the CICIDS2017 open source data set, a
   series of comparative experiments are conducted. The method \&\#x02BC s
   real-time detection efficiency is higher than that of traditional
   machine learning algorithms. The attack classification accuracy is 0.7
   percentage points higher than that of a DBN, which is 2 percentage
   points higher than that of the integrated algorithm boosting and bagging
   methods. Hence, it is suitable for the real-time detection of high-speed
   network intrusions.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a fast algorithm for retrieving plane geometry
   diagrams. Retrieving plane geometry diagrams has become an active
   research problem because that it is critical technology in various
   applications of searching the relevant materials of plane geometry such
   as search engine and auto tutorial system. Several existing systems use
   the features extracted from geometric diagram to retrieve the relevant
   materials of exercise problems of plane geometry, which achieve the
   better performance than the ones by using the keywords extracted from
   text. However, the existing retrieval methods do not consider the
   property of different features. This paper proposes a hierarchical
   strategy, which conducts the global-to-local bilayer retrieval. The
   first layer efficiently reduces the ranges by using global features; the
   second layer finds the relevant diagrams by using local features. This
   coarse-to-fine procedure can retrieve a short list of relevant diagrams
   with high similarity to the input diagram. This good performance lies in
   that the global features can describe the similarity of global
   structures and the local features can describe the delicate inner
   structure of diagrams. The experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed algorithm can achieve good performance against the
   state-of-arts methods in terms of retrieval quality.},

Abstract = {Target tracking has always been a hot research topic in the field of
   computer vision. Tracking-Learning-Detection (TLD) is a new algorithm
   for online learning tracking proposed by Zdenek Kalal. In the algorithm,
   the computation consuming of detection module is relatively large. To
   solve this problem and improve the algorithm, we proposed an online
   learning method to adaptively update the threshold of variance
   classifier, which can effectively reduce the number of target boxes,
   improve the real-time performance and tracking accuracy. Experiments
   have been conducted to compare the performance of the improved TLD with
   the original TLD. The experimental results show that the improved TLD
   has better real-time performance and higher accuracy for tracking.},

Abstract = {Quality video open course has played an important role in expanding the
   transmission of high-quality educational resource in universities and
   promoting the balanced development of educational resources. The
   production method and technology of quality video open courses directly
   determine the quality of the course and affect its application effect.
   Due to the lack of unified standard or template, the overall level of
   current quality video open course is not high enough. Under the guide of
   National Standard on Production Technology of Quality Video Open Course,
   this paper focuses on the target needs of the construction of the video
   open course, and a practical and effective shooting and making method is
   proposed by combining the video production industry norms and the
   current development trend of video technology. The whole production
   process, including the preparation, shooting and post-editing are all
   described in detail, and some important skills and matters needing
   attention are introduced for reference. The proposed method has been
   tried and tested in Central China Normal University and its
   effectiveness and efficiency has been successfully confirmed.},

Title = {Semi-random subspace method for writeprint identification},
Journal = {NEUROCOMPUTING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {93-102},
Month = {MAY 2},
Abstract = {The anonymous nature of online messages distribution causes a series of
   moral and legal issues. By analyzing identity cues people leave behind
   their texts, i.e., writeprint, potential authors can be identified
   individually. But writeprint identification is a difficult learning
   task, because of the high redundancy in stylistic feature set and high
   similarity of some authors' writing-style. In this paper, we propose a
   novel method, called semi-random subspace (Semi-RS), to simultaneously
   address the two problems. Different from the conventional random
   subspace method (RSM) which samples features from the whole feature set
   in a completely random way, the proposed Semi-RS randomly samples
   features on each individual-author feature set (IAFS) partitioned from
   the whole feature set. More specifically, we first divide the whole
   feature set into several IAFSs in a deterministic way, then construct a
   set of base classifiers on different randomly sampled feature sets from
   each IAFS, and finally combine all base classifiers for the final
   decision. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method which improves previously reported
   results. In addition, we analyze the diversity of algorithm, reveals
   that Semi-RS constructs more diverse base classifiers than conventional
   RSMs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {With the popularization development of MOOC platform, the number of
   online courses grows rapidly. Efficient and appropriate course
   recommendation can improve learning efficiency. Traditional
   recommendation system is applied to the closed educational environment
   in which the quantity of courses and users is relatively stable.
   Recommendation model and algorithm cannot directly be applied to MOOC
   platform efficiently. With the light of the characteristics of MOOC
   platform, MCRS proposed in this paper has made great improvement in the
   course recommendation model and recommendation algorithm. MCRS is based
   on distributed computation framework. The basic algorithm of MCRS is
   distributed association rules mining algorithm, which based on the
   improvement of Apriori algorithm. In addition, it is useful to mine the
   hidden courses rules in course enrollment data. Firstly, the data is
   pre-processed into a standard form by Hadoop. It aims to improve the
   efficiency of the basic algorithm. Then it mines association rules of
   the standard data by Spark. Consequently, course recommendation
   information is transferred into MySQL through Sqoop, which makes timely
   feedback and improves user's courses retrieval efficiency. Finally, to
   validate the efficiency of MCRS, a series of experiments are carried out
   on Hadoop and Spark, and the results shows that MCRS is more efficient
   than traditional Apriori algorithm and Apriori algorithm based on
   Hadoop, and the MCRS is suitable for current MOOC platform.},

Abstract = {With the development of the Internet and the popularity of Big Data,
   recommender systems have become an indispensable field due to its
   excellent ability to solve the problem of information overload. The
   existing recommender system mainly uses collaborative filtering to make
   recommendation by mining the interaction relationship between users and
   items. In order to better analyze the interaction relationship between
   users and items, a hybrid recommender method based on multiple dimension
   attention analysis is proposed. The idea is to fuse the embedded vectors
   of users and items into mapping vectors (or matrices) of different
   shapes through different methods, and learn the interactive relationship
   between users and items through the neural network model with attention
   mechanism. Experimental results show that compared with traditional
   analytical methods, multiple dimension analysis can more comprehensively
   explore the interaction between users and items, and the attention
   mechanism can greatly improve the analytical ability of the model.},

Abstract = {With the widespread application of computer network technology, diverse
   anonymous cyber crimes begin to appear in the online community. The
   anonymous nature of online-information distribution makes writeprint
   identification a critical forensic problem. But the difficulty of the
   task is the huge number of features in even a moderate-sized available
   text corpus, which causes the problem of over-training. In this paper,
   we proposed a novel random subspace method by constructing a set of
   stable classifiers to take advantage of nearly all the discriminative
   information in the high dimensional feature space. In the construction
   of base classifiers, an optimized synergetic neural network is employed
   to provide probabilistic information for each class. Performance results
   on the subset of Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) show that the proposed
   random subspace method achieves the better identification performance
   than a single classifier and conventional random subspace methods.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that protein complex is composed of core
   proteins and attachment proteins, and proteins inside the core are
   highly co-expressed. Based on this new concept, we reconstruct weighted
   PPI network by using gene expression data, and develop a novel protein
   complex identification algorithm from the angle of edge (PCIA-GeCo).
   First, we select the edge with high co-expressed coefficient as seed to
   form the preliminary cores. Then, the preliminary cores are filtered
   according to the weighted density of complex core to obtain the unique
   core. Finally, the protein complexes are generated by identifying
   attachment proteins for each core. A comprehensive comparison in term of
   F-measure, Coverage rate, P-value between our method and three other
   existing algorithms HUNTER, COACH and CORE has been made by comparing
   the predicted complexes against benchmark complexes. The evaluation
   results show our method PCIA-GeCo is effective; it can identify protein
   complexes more accurately.},
