Abstract = {Mobile Heutagogy (M-Heutagogy) is the teaching practice that emphasizes
   self-determined learning and student autonomy. Many teachers and
   academicians have applied M-Heutagogy in their teaching and learning in
   Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The purpose of this study is to
   synthesize an empirical literature review of the M-Heutagogical practice
   among Higher Education students and its acceptance. The main objective
   of this paper is to review the literature on M-Heutagogy practice and
   its acceptance among Higher Education students. The researcher conducted
   a systematic review of 60 articles for the period 2007 to 2020. The
   findings indicate that M-Heutagogy has been applied in HEIs around the
   world with the support of emergent technologies and mobile applications.
   Unfortunately, only two M-Heutagogy acceptance studies have been done so
   far. Future research suggested that the M-Heutagogy acceptance model
   should be developed to be referred by researchers while doing an
   acceptance study.},

Title = {The dynamic mix of heutagogy and technology: Preparing learners for
   lifelong learning},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {With the swift pivot to online learning, teachers and students have been
   forced to adopt a new way of teaching and learning, which has required
   students to become more self-directed in their learning. In addition,
   teachers are faced with the challenge of preparing students for the
   workforce and lifelong learning. One emerging approach for addressing
   both these challenges is that of heutagogy, or self-determined learning.
   This paper discusses the rising demand for lifelong learning skills and
   the role that heutagogy can play in supporting students in developing
   self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Specifically, the paper
   presents a case study of a higher education institution that has
   introduced heutagogy, using interviews with programme
   leaders/instructors to investigate how a college in Israel incorporated
   heutagogy into their master's education programmes. Case study results
   reveal that there are challenges in incorporating heutagogy (eg,
   difficulty for students in adopting the approach), but once adopted,
   students preferred learning in a self-determined way.
   Practitioner notes
   What is already known about this topic?
   Lifelong learning skills are critical to student employability, and
   there is a need for exploring new theories and approaches for developing
   these skills.
   The current pandemic has forced traditional learning into the online
   space, requiring more self-directed learning skills in learners.
   Heutagogy has been identified as a net-centric teaching and learning
   theory for online learning.
   What this paper adds
   Positions heutagogy for use in traditional and online classroom settings
   in order to develop learners' self-directed and lifelong learning
   skills.
   Explores the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum and its use as an
   instructional strategy.
   Presents a case study of a higher education institution that has
   implemented self-determined learning.
   Implications for practice and/or policy
   This study encourages further research into use of heutagogy for
   developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills.
   This study provides guidance for those who want to introduce
   self-determined learning into classroom settings.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to address the United Nations' Sustainable
   Development Goal 4 ``quality education{''} through the adoption of
   heutagogic ideas in improving work-based learning for individuals.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper locates a discussion of
   heutagogy within the wider context of vocational and higher education,
   as well as through reference to the theoretical discourse on learning
   theory. Findings - Heutagogy is concerned with the development of
   individual capability through the creation of a learner-determined
   curriculum that is attuned to professional goals. Organizations that
   adopt heutagogic approaches enhance corporate adaptiveness through
   personalized learning. Originality/value - This briefing provides the
   reader with an accessible insight into both the individual and
   organizational benefits of adopting heutagogic ideas in professional
   development. As organizations confront an increasingly uncertain
   external environment, this paper offers an insight into how to develop
   individual capability.},

Title = {Heutagogy as an alternative in teacher education: conceptions of
   lecturers and pre-service teachers of school of education and life-long
   learning, SDD-UBIDS},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Introduction The needs of today's higher education have changed and
   higher education does not need a one-way communication from teacher to
   student but rather learn to appreciate the new role of the teacher as a
   facilitator with mutual responsibilities toward the creation of
   knowledge. Heutagogy, which emphasizes learner autonomy and the creation
   of self-determined learners, has garnered attention as a potential
   solution to address the evolving needs of teacher preparation. However,
   empirical research on the beliefs and attitudes of Heutagogy within the
   teacher education context remains limited. This study aimed to fill this
   gap by exploring the beliefs and attitudes of lecturers and pre-service
   teachers of the School of Education and Life-Long Learning (SoELL) at
   SDD-UBIDS.Methods Convergent mixed method design with both quantitative
   and qualitative data analysis, the study collected both quantitative and
   qualitative data on 513 Pre-service teachers and 30 Lecturers from
   SoELL, SDD-UBIDS using a four-point Likert scale questionnaire and
   interview.Results The findings revealed diverse perspectives among
   Lecturers and Pre-service Teachers regarding Heutagogy, with varying
   levels of understanding, acceptance, and readiness for implementation.
   Lecturers expressed enthusiasm for Heutagogy's potential to foster
   learner autonomy and critical thinking skills, while pre-service
   teachers demonstrated varying levels of readiness and comfort with
   self-directed learning approaches.Discussion Lecturers and Pre-service
   teachers expressed willingness to embrace a self-determined approach in
   which the learner reflects on what is learned and how it is learned and
   where the Lecturers teach the learners how to learn by themselves. The
   cognitive conflict and the inadequacy of pre-service teachers'
   preparedness will necessitate a shift in their attitudes toward
   developing autonomy skills to effectively navigate the challenges of the
   21st-century knowledge economy.},

Abstract = {Lifelong education is increasingly popular among Malaysians in
   accordance with the formation of a stable economy. The need for
   education is no longer limited, and this education has given equal
   opportunities to all citizens, especially to the working class.
   Therefore, this study is to identify the elements of need that the
   educational student needs throughout the development of m-learning for
   lifelong education. A total of 11 experts were selected to analyze the
   fuzziness consensus of experts. All of the data obtained will be
   analyzed using the Fuzzy Delphi method. The findings show that
   smartphones are the most appropriate devices in helping students with
   thorough education and the smartphones sit at the first position as
   compared to tablet PC and laptop devices. Whereas, the six heutagogy
   elements that explore, create, connect, share, reflect, and collaborate
   have reached unity with the threshold value of d <= 0.2 and the
   percentage of the expert group is more than 75\%. However, the sharing
   elements have the highest position in the development of modules for
   lifelong education. Therefore, based on the consensus agreements, the
   development of modules for these lifelong educational students should be
   incorporated with the elements of heutagogy according to the position in
   the expert consensus.},

Abstract = {Preparing students for the complex and changing nature of the workforce
   has become an overriding objective within higher education. New
   pedagogies, which incorporate both informal and formal learning and
   support personalization of learning, are central to this objective.
   Educators are required to reassess the use of traditional pedagogies, as
   they attempt to foster development of skills and competencies for
   lifelong learning. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is a learning
   theory that addresses this need, giving students agency in determining
   what and how they learn. The theory is based in the principles of
   learner agency, capability and self-efficacy, reflection and
   metacognition, and non-linear learning, and when used with technology
   can be a powerful instructional approach for building students'
   self-directed and lifelong learning skills. A compelling example of this
   is the e-portfolio. As a platform and assessment tool, the e-portfolio
   spans the spectrum of lifelong learning, as well as encompasses both
   formal and informal learning of the individual learner and addresses
   critical aspects of learning and reflection, showcasing the learner's
   acquired skills and competencies. Based on successful cases in the
   literature, this article discusses the principles of heutagogy, the
   pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH continuum) and its application in
   online learning environments, and the use of the eportfolio in further
   cultivating and advancing self-determined learning. The article also
   offers recommendations for future practice and theory.},

Abstract = {This empirical qualitative study investigates whether the introduction
   of heutagogy in contemporary nursing education can foster the
   development of the digital self-determined learner, who is prepared to
   work and live in the fourth industrial age and beyond. The impact of
   heutagogical design on learner process and outcomes is explored through
   qualitative framework analysis of learner data and reflective educator
   observations. Findings suggest that with careful scaffolding and courage
   in remaining true to the educational philosophy, this approach has the
   potential to develop learners who demonstrate key principles of
   heutagogy including non-linear learning, learner agency, capability,
   self-reflection and metacognition and double-loop learning. This
   innovative study provides insight into the process of developing the
   self-determined learner and encourages further research into flexible
   and learner-centred approaches across Higher Education.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of neurodivergent learners attend higher education.
   This necessitates examination of best-fit learning models to
   successfully support the current generation of college students. While
   pedagogy and andragogy have historical relevance, in isolation, they may
   lack alignment with the individualization embedded in
   neurodiversity-affirming practice. This study conceptualized a novel
   learning framework for neurodivergent college students through the lens
   of neurodiversity-affirming practice. Via constant comparative
   qualitative analysis of American university faculty interviews and
   framework juxtaposition, three themes were identified: pedagogy vs.
   andragogy, self-determination, and interdependency. Thematic analysis
   revealed uncertainty regarding best-fit learning framework, with
   consensus reached regarding complexity of serving neurodivergent adults
   in post-secondary settings. An innovative framework titled ``Building a
   Heutagogical Bridge{''} was envisioned, describing the role of
   heutagogy, student-centered, self-determined learning, in connecting
   signature pedagogical and andragogical approaches. This study revealed
   the potentiality of implementing and assessing approaches to skillfully
   incorporate heutagogical, pedagogical, and andragogical principles in
   higher education settings. The perspectives of faculty from the USA
   within this study can inform neurodiversity-affirming practice in
   American universities, while providing implications for future study and
   practice in international college settings, where contexts, needs, and
   culture may differ.},

Abstract = {Educators play the most crucial role in the education system. They are
   the cornerstone on which the stability and growth of the education
   system, including technical and vocational education. In the current
   situation, the teaching-learning process shall be decided based on the
   requirements of the learner at every level. With fast changing
   technology and education norm, educators faced many challenges and took
   various way in upgrading and reskilling themselves towards providing
   practical teaching session. Therefore, heutagogical approaches are
   appropriate for improving skill and knowledge among them. This study is
   aimed to determine the efforts level of educator in 13 different
   Vocational colleges in Johor. A total of 141 educators participated in
   the survey questionnaire that measures their efforts toward six
   heutagogical elements in teaching and learning. The finding shows that
   majority of the educators shows the high level of efforts toward
   improving their skills and knowledge. The educator's perception on the
   implementation of heutagogy in teaching and learning process benefit
   tremendously in designing practical and sustainable professional
   development course for educators. Also contributes to heutagogy model in
   technical and vocational education settings.},

   conceptualising the ways in which academics in a business school view

Abstract = {Teaching and learning in higher education is informed by a multitude of
   conditioning factors, not least the values systems and outlook of
   academics. Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by
   academics in relation to teaching and learning is therefore important if
   we are to make judgments about how we educate now, and could do so in
   the future. Developments in educational theory and digital technology
   have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in which students learn,
   and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses from
   universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the
   future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has
   attracted interest from those who wish to see greater student control
   over the learning journey- but how widespread is this view amongst
   academics? This paper reports on a qualitative study in which 12
   academics in an English Business School were asked to describe their
   views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate through the
   concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is little
   epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are
   going to innovate, then additional resource and professional development
   should be put in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in
   their epistemological positioning. The paper conceptualises academics'
   positioning through a typology of epistemic views.},

Title = {Creating technology-enabled lifelong learning: A heutagogical approach},

Abstract = {Can a new instructional approach influence lifelong learning and the
   development of competent lifelong learners? Blended and online learning
   provides a platform for learning that introduces technological
   affordance to enable learning. We seek to find an intersection between
   blended and online learning and lifelong learning through an
   instructional approach that encourages learners towards management of
   their own learning. This opens the door to becoming an autonomous,
   capable, self-directed lifelong learner. In this context, heutagogy
   offers an instructional approach that may connect blended and online
   learning settings with the development of lifelong learning competence.
   After conducting a systematic literature review using the terms
   heutagogy, blended and online learning, and lifelong learning,
   literature that considers how to inspire and build human agency
   capabilities over the lifespan was chosen for Delphi method expert
   review. Using this methodology, we explore the possibility that online
   and blended higher education will contribute, where heutagogical
   experiences exist, to technology-enabled lifelong learning. Results
   corroborate the idea that heutagogy and lifelong learning are
   intertwined by some common principles and that these are applicable to
   both blended and online learning settings and lifelong learning.
   Practitioner notes
   What is already known about this topic
   Recent, and what is often continuous, change is impacting all we do,
   including the design and delivery of education.
   This change requires new instructional models that improve immediate
   learning outcomes and prepares learners for learning across the
   lifespan.
   The use of instructional processes labeled heutagogy include the
   opportunity for, and application of, activities of learning
   self-direction, -determination, and -regulation, which can be helpful,
   even essential, for lifelong learning.
   What this paper adds
   This paper identifies an informed perspective, from data, that
   heutagogical design must be consciously implemented and supported for
   online and blended learning by instructional designers, instructors, and
   institutional leadership and infrastructure.
   It is reasonable to suggest that online and blended learning could
   contribute, where heutagogical learning opportunities exist, to
   technology-enabled lifelong learning.
   Instructional practices that include choice, flexible or negotiated
   assessment, facilitation of reflection, learner confidence development,
   and involvement of the learner in designing their learning can be
   considered heutagogical.
   Implications for practice and/or policy
   Develop policy in support of a change in instructional practice that
   embraces a heutagogical approach in the design of courses to foster
   greater self-directed and lifelong learning.
   Educational development to support instructors to understand heutagogy
   and how it can be applied in the design and delivery of blended and
   online learning to foster technology enabled lifelong learning.
   With the implementation of a heutagogical approach, student orientation
   along with purposeful scaffolding needs to be implemented to support
   students as they become more autonomous learners in technology-enabled
   settings.},

Abstract = {The development of the digital transformation era has had a major
   influence on the current occupational fields. The challenges faced by
   the next generation of the nation are getting bigger; this is also felt
   by internship teachers (teacher training) who carry out school field
   introduction programs from universities. Seeing the low output to be
   able to get the opportunity to become a teacher with a bachelor's degree
   in education is the main concern of inequitable global civilization. The
   aim of the research is to focus on knowing the needs of internship
   teachers related to digital competence training before they carry out
   the school field introduction program. The research method used is a
   mixed method with a total of 160 active students at Brawijaya University
   who will become internship teachers. The results of the study reveal
   that the need for the aspect of gaining new competencies is 85\%, the
   development of digital competencies is very high, especially in the
   aspect of integrating digital pedagogy, and the knowledge aspect is 65\%
   for increasing heutagogy-based e-training experiences. This study
   concludes that the need for internship teachers for the existence of
   heutagogy-based e-training is very much needed to realize an equitable
   global civilization in the era of digital transformation.},

Abstract = {Pedagogical foundations exist for incorporating technology in
   instruction; however, these foundations have not kept pace with
   technology's evolution. Through the use of Information Communication
   Technologies (ICTs), students now can share content directed at external
   audiences, i.e., audiences other than the instructor. These audiences
   are referred to as authentic audiences as they are public-facing and
   exist outside of the classroom. The existing literature offers evidence
   of student satisfaction with assignments directed at appealing to
   external audiences, however, the literature provides no comprehensive
   pedagogical rationale for assignments directed at authentic audiences
   wherein the goals are self-determined. The authors discuss the theory of

Title = {Guiding the student entrepreneur - Considering the emergent adult within
   the pedagogy-andragogy continuum in entrepreneurship education},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND TRAINING},

Number = {7-8, SI},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of the paper is to build on current discussions
   about the need for and role of guidance in learning and teaching, as
   well as to theoretically develop its specifics to further advance our
   scholarly understanding of how to structure and enhance entrepreneurship
   education. Design/methodology/approach The paper takes a synthesizing
   conceptual approach, built on developmental psychology, instructional
   science, expertise research as well as the pedagogy-andragogy discussion
   and the role of guidance in contemporary entrepreneurship education
   research. In addition, a new term, odigogy, is developed. Findings
   Odigogy, from the Greek word odigos (to guide), addresses how to
   navigate student entrepreneurs in higher education. The term seeks to
   correspond both to the specifics of entrepreneurship as a subject and
   the characteristics of students in the classroom who are in a
   transitional phase between adolescence and adulthood. Practical
   implications The paper contributes to current entrepreneurship education
   discussions by offering a more balanced terminology positioned between
   how to teach (pedagogy) and how adults learn (andragogy). The paper
   provides insights for teachers when developing teaching methods and
   learning activities in higher education. Originality/value By
   introducing the term odigogy the paper seeks to contribute an enhanced
   understanding of the entrepreneurial learning process in higher
   education, which does not match pedagogical assumptions on how to teach
   children or adolescents, nor andragogical assumptions on how adults
   learn, or how to engage students in self-directed learning as presented
   in heutagogy.},

Abstract = {This study concerns the degree of autonomy in English Language Learning
   (ELL) amongst the ESL (English as a Second Language) teacher trainees in
   Sarawak. This is part of a larger study which aims to investigate the
   relationship between ESL teacher trainees' self-rating in ELL and their
   degree of autonomy based on their perceived ELL. The
   Pedagogy-Andragogy-Heutagogy Continuum Framework is used to guide the
   study. Data were collected from questionnaire distributed to 259 ESL
   trainee teachers from four IPG (Teacher Training Institute) campuses in
   Sarawak. The data were analysed through descriptive analysis and
   correlation tests using SPSS version 22. The results revealed that the
   degree of autonomy of the ESL teacher trainees in ELL is high with
   significant but weak relationship between their self-rating with ELL and
   their degree of autonomy. This study adds to the limited data on the
   learner autonomy of ESL teacher trainees which should be addressed in
   the Malaysian Education Blueprint. We recommend that future education
   policy gives more attention in developing teacher trainees' learner
   autonomy in order to ensure the alignment between second language
   teacher training and the development of 21st century learner skills as
   stated in the Malaysian Education Blueprint.},

Abstract = {Work-based learning (WBL) has long been recognized and lauded for its
   transformative capabilities, enriching the knowledge and organizational
   and cultural impact of its learners. Students deepen understanding of
   their sector as well as professional interdisciplinarity on work-based
   academic programs, and in focusing on real-world scenarios in a
   scholarly way, open up opportunities for improvement and change.
   However, one of the key challenges in sustaining or continually
   improving provision for work-based learners in this context is in
   evidencing impact of enhancement-based, in-program learning and teaching
   activities. This chapter will examine some of the ways in which WBL
   values influence academic support delivery at one United Kingdom (UK)
   Higher Education Institution (HEI) and present examples of the
   operationalization of some WBL-driving principles in practice. In so
   doing, this chapter aims to share some of the tenets underpinning WBL
   practices in the UK in exploring its potential role and contribution as
   a socially responsible endeavor.},

   Always Come First.},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream
   of society some twelve months ago has seriously challenged learning and
   teaching practice. Since then, AI companies such as OpenAI are
   constantly improving their language models and releasing new features to
   make them more capable and useful. So, given there have been many
   disruptors in the past and emerging disruptions in the present, what can
   we learn in this situation, where Generative AI stands poised to
   challenge the purpose and relevance of assessment models? From our
   examples, disruptive technologies only have a major impact when they
   positively transform practice and are informed by pedagogic models and
   learning theory. GenAI as a disruptor is only likely to have this
   positive impact when it informs quality learning and teaching practice.
   We should be focused on the opportunities that GenAI now presents to
   higher education. It is argued here and elsewhere that the relative
   weakness of GenAI is that it creates poor quality output, delivering
   uninformed, incorrect, biased and bland responses. In itself, this
   offers opportunities for `teachable moments' (Newell et al, 2023) and
   gives us room to support students with their capabilities in an AI
   informed world. Historically, these opportunities enable higher
   education to grow and progress. What we have learned so far would
   appears to be that for research to contribute to the literature, they
   needed to be informed by it. Likewise, need to ensure that pedagogy,
   andragogy, and heutagogy come first. We also need to remember that
   people processes happen, artificial intelligence happens around them,
   and that artificial intelligence comes after human intelligence.
   Practitioner Notes1. For AI research to contribute to the literature, it
   needs to be informed by it.2. Scholars need to ensure that pedagogy,
   andragogy, and heutagogy come before artificial intelligence.3. People
   processes happen, artificial intelligence happens around them, and that
   artificial intelligence comes after human intelligence. 4. Artificial
   Intelligence comes after human intelligence},

Abstract = {In higher education, heutagogical design principles may be utilized to
   foster active teaching and learning to engage learners in an online
   learning environment. This research study aims to investigate the
   application of heutagogical design principles such as exploration,
   creation, collaboration, connection, reflection, and knowledge sharing.
   Therefore, a scoping review was conducted to identify and analyze the
   potential use of heutagogical design principles across a variety of
   online instructional approaches, including personalized learning, peer
   learning, smart learning, self-regulated learning, independent learning,
   learner-centered learning, facilitative learning, collaborative
   learning, free-choice learning, and lifelong learning within the
   theoretical framework of heutagogy. The results revealed that the most
   frequent instructional approaches included collaboration,
   self-regulation, personalization, and lifelong learning. Thus,
   instructional approaches encouraged students to connect with peers and
   instructors within the facilitative learning environment. As a result,
   instructors developed students' 21st century skills in the scope of
   engaging, meaningful, and experiential learning environments. Online
   teaching and learning in higher education might be diversified based on
   heutagogical principles and instructional approaches and their
   subsequent implementation in the context of higher education.},

Abstract = {In this study, we aim to investigate the potential advantages of
   integrating the new generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
   ChatGPT, into higher education, specifically within the field of medical
   education. The focus is on exploring ChatGPT's applications in
   personalized learning, assessment, and content creation while also
   addressing the management of its limitations and ethical considerations.
   Furthermore, we explore the use of ChatGPT as a medical instructor in a
   medical classroom context. We seek to elucidate responses to a preset of
   questions in two categories separated based on targeted remediation,
   pedagogical knowledge, teacher ethics, query detail, practicality, and
   communication pattern. These responses are analyzed based on two rubrics
   designed on the basics of pedagogical prerequisites, and findings are
   reached with a thorough comparative analysis. We hope that this research
   will improve the effective implementation of ChatGPT as a tool for
   enhancing learning and skill development while maintaining ethical
   awareness for medical professionals.},

   amplified autonomy. Second-year students at North-West University (South
   Africa) will be the first cohort to experience the application of the
   newly-designed basic literacy framework which informs the broader
   role-playing learning design exhibited here. The Web literacy framework
   put forward by Mozilla in 2018 to teach critical online proficiencies
   serves as the inspiration for the framework; informing the overall
   role-playing learning design at various levels. Depth of Knowledge
   indicators are mapped onto the Mozilla framework to deepen its
   applicability to tertiary education contexts. Elements of gamification,
   furthermore, are imbedded into the learning design to engage students
   with the self-directed learning aspects of the concept itself, i.e. to
   participate in authentic learning experiences as put forward by
   heutagogical instructional strategies. The role-playing learning design
   makes three roles available to learners, namely: Business Analyst
   (Read), Web Developer (Write) and Customer Service Representative
   (Engage). These roles are tied directly to the three basic literacy
   skill areas iterated upon in the basic literacy framework discussed
   here. Moreover, this article represents part one in a series of articles
   exploring the efficacy and potential of this approach to better serve
   our student cohorts and expand educational offerings. Proceeding papers},

Abstract = {The Covid 19 pandemic requires critical re-evaluation of the way Higher
   Education can help students maximise their learning to adjust and adapt
   to a new reality. This requires a holistic approach which extends beyond
   consideration of student learning in formal settings to understanding
   the role informal learning can play. Whilst research exists on informal
   independent learning, less focus has been placed on how students
   collaborate informally as part of their learning process. In this study
   interviews with HE students in Spain and the UK offer insight into
   variable but beneficial informal collaborative learning (ICL) practices.
   The value attributed to ICL emphasises its potential contribution to the
   current educational landscape and the merit of recognising it as a
   distinct concept. Further, uneven access and the role of learner
   maturity signal the potential for universities to enhance learning and
   increase access by playing an active a role in developing ICL skills and
   personal networks.},

Abstract = {Higher teacher education in European countries has undergone a
   remarkable transformation due to the constant convergence of educational
   systems and institutions of higher education in Western Europe. The aim
   of the article is to analyze the experience of using innovative
   technologies in higher pedagogical education in the European Union
   countries. Methods of analysis and synthesis, prediction, comparison,
   and abstraction were used to realize this main task. The results traced
   the main innovative technologies popular in European pedagogical
   universities. The effectiveness of interactive learning, modular
   education system, technology of level differentiation, methods of
   learning through research (use of the project method), E-learning, and
   deep use of digital platforms, which contributes to the formation of
   theoretical and practical knowledge, development of critical thinking
   and creative potential in higher education applicants is demonstrated.
   It is pointed out that e-learning based on university platforms allows
   users to actively participate in various international educational
   projects, creatively interact with other users and even create new
   content. Several European universities (from France, Germany, Austria,
   and other countries) have merged their e-learning platforms into one
   professional global service called web2.0. Important directions for the
   further development of teacher education will be heutagogy, peeragogy,
   or paragogy and cybergogy. The conclusions stressed the importance of
   further integration of digital innovative methods to teaching
   pedagogical disciplines.},

Journal = {MOVIMENTO},
Year = {2023},

Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the initial development of a
   learner -centered teaching (LCT) in the ``Sports Coach{''} course, from
   the Sports Science program at University of Campinas. Following a
   qualitative approach and action research procedures, we present the
   planning, implementation, and evaluation of the LCT in the course
   through the program and institutional plan, class plans and logbook; the
   teachers' perspective through critical-reflective conversations and
   logbook entries; the opinions of the student-coaches through
   questionnaires and focus group. We used the thematic analysis technique.
   The LCT showed to be complex, especially due to the appropriation of
   principles and development as an approach. The student-coaches perceived
   an approximation of the course to the practical reality of the coach,
   contributing to motivation and significant learning. We emphasize the
   need to train teachers in LCT and to take the role of coach developers
   in coach education in university.},

Abstract = {To enhance the current postgraduate educational learning environment,
   this quasi-experimental case study examined the implementation of the
   Pedagogy-Andragogy-Heutagogy (PAH) Continuum as an instructional
   framework for developing basic competencies and learner autonomy among
   50 postgraduate students. This is in response to the high attrition
   rates and students' failure to graduate on time, afflicting the quality
   of postgraduate education in Malaysia. Data were collected via pre and
   post-tests, a questionnaire, and focus-group interviews. The findings
   revealed significant improvement in the students' critical reading and
   research skills, while their learner autonomy level was moderate due to
   personal and cultural limitations.},

Title = {May student-centered principles affect active learning and its
   counterpart? An empirical study of Indonesian curriculum implementation},
Journal = {SAGE OPEN},
Year = {2023},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Education 4.0 emphasizes the use of hybrid approaches in the learning
   process. The use of peeragogy, heutagogy, and cybergogy may engage
   students in the learning processes in which active learning plays a key
   role. This study aimed to examine the effect of the implementation of
   the Merdeka Curriculum on active learning practices and their
   relationships with hybrid activities based on hybrid learning
   approaches, and active learning counterparts of (1) self-regulated
   learning: (2) self-directed learning, and (3) self-determined learning.
   These relationships will be examined in Indonesian curriculum
   implementation in which student-centered principles are emphasized. A
   cross-sectional survey was conducted by collecting responses of
   vocational high school students on survey. The digital questionnaire was
   sent to 600 Indonesian students, of whom 555 completed it. The
   relationships among the constructs were examined using a structural
   equation modeling. The results showed that a curriculum emphasizing
   student-centered principles was fully mediated by active learning and
   hybrid activities to promote student self-regulated learning (SRL),
   self-determined learning (SDET), and self-directed learning (SDL).
   Active learning and hybrid activities directly affect students' SRL,
   SDET, and SDL, Three counterparts of active learning that form important
   parts of long-life learning. This model indicates that Indonesian
   curriculum implementation may encourage active learning and indirectly
   increase learner engagement, autonomy, and metacognitive development.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {For transformation to occur in learning environments and for learners,
   higher education must first consider how such transformation will occur
   for the designers and facilitators of learning experiences: the
   university teachers or educators we call faculty (in the US),
   instructors, lecturers or professors or, in some instances, university
   staff. For the purpose of this article, we will refer to them as
   educators or faculty, and the process of their professional development
   as educational development or faculty development (more historically
   common in the US context). We aspire towards universities in the future
   that cultivate connected, participatory educational development that
   crosses institutional and national boundaries, and which takes equity,
   social justice and power differences into consideration, promoting
   educator agency. We propose theoretical underpinnings of our approach,
   while also highlighting some examples of recent practice that inspire
   this direction, but which are small in scale, and can provide
   springboards for future approaches that may be applied on a wider scale
   and become more fully integrated, supported and rewarded in
   institutions. Our theoretical underpinnings are influenced by theories
   of heutagogy and self-determined learning, transformative learning,
   connectivist and connected learning, and an interest in equity.We share
   models of alternative approaches to educator development that take
   advantage of the latest advances in technology, such as \#DigPINS,
   Virtually Connecting, collaborative annotation, and dual-pathway MOOCs.
   We then share a semi-fictional authoethnography of our (the authors')
   daily connected lives, and we end by highlighting elements of the models
   we shared that we feel could be adapted by institutions to achieve
   educator professional development that is more transformative,
   participatory, and equitable.},

Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {One of the important things in the Industrial Revolution 4.0 era was
   online learning. Therefore, this article describes data about student
   perceptions related to online learning and data on how long students
   have been familiar with the internet, what devices are used, and what
   they are used for. This data includes all departments in the Faculty of
   Mathematics and Natural Sciences of Universitas Negeri Makassar (FMIPA
   UNM), Indonesia. The sample in this data are 250 students from various
   departments at FMIPA UNM. The data collection method used was a
   questionnaire. The results of this data collection we present some of
   the questions variables/items included in the dataset. The findings from
   the data show that about 75\% of students of FMIPA UNM agree with the
   use of online learning. In general, the characteristics of students in
   every province in Indonesia are ``similar{''} in terms of thinking
   related to online learning i.e. millennial students, moreover most
   students already use the internet as a primary need for learning, so
   this data has policy implications for higher education in Indonesia
   during the industrial revolution 4.0. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {To aid and better understand the current postgraduate educational
   learning environment, this study examined the implementation of the
   Pedagogy-Andragogy-Heutagogy (PAH) Continuum as an instructional
   framework for developing competencies and learner autonomy among
   postgraduate (PG) students. This is in response to the high attrition
   rates and postgraduate students' failure to graduate on time, afflicting
   the quality of PG education in Malaysia. A mixed-method descriptive case
   study design was employed, involving pre and post-tests, a
   questionnaire, and focus-group interviews. The findings revealed
   significant improvement in the students' critical reading and research
   skills, while their autonomy level was moderate due to personal and
   cultural limitations.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the level of readiness for massive open online
   courses (MOOCs) of students in Oman. It compares the readiness of
   ordinary students in the Omani higher education institutions (HEIs) and
   those outside HEIs who took a MOOC from the larger Omani society and
   tests for the differences between their levels of readiness.
   Additionally, it tests for the best predictor for future participation
   in MOOCs. In this study, readiness is defined as the possession of three
   sets of skills: technological, metacognitive, and motivational. A
   sequential two-phase research approach was used by first collecting data
   from 428 students in different HEIs and then collecting the same data
   from 253 non-HEI students from the general public who were offered and
   took a MOOC specifically designed for this study. While high levels of
   the three sets of skills were found in both study samples, the MOOC
   students were found to have significantly higher motivational and
   metacognitive skills than the higher education students. In this study,
   binary regression results indicate that comfort with eLearning is the
   best predictor for future participation in MOOCs. Given the high student
   readiness for MOOCs in Oman in this study, some recommendations are
   provided for higher education institutions to benefit from the
   fast-moving MOOC phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Since the earliest adoption of educational technologies, teachers and
   researchers have been exploring its efficacy on language learning and
   development. The speed with which these technologies are now
   infiltrating academic student support will continue to increase, and so
   the need for good guidance in this space will likewise increase.
   Currently in academic language and learning support, however, the
   digital space while prevalent and expanding is both poorly defined and
   the literature widely dispersed. It is argued here that a single term of
   reference, such as TALS, could provide a centralised meeting point where
   research and experiences from the field can be more readily and

Title = {Diverse class participation formats as a heutagogical approach to
   integrate student voice in higher education},
Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 8},
Abstract = {Class participation is integral to student learning as it promotes
   engagement and the expression of student voices. However, attempting to
   `get students to talk' without acknowledging their diverse identities
   and needs can inadvertently reinforce oppression. Grounded in a
   heutagogical framework, this action research was conducted to address
   this limitation and advocate for diverse participation formats, such as
   inviting students to share relevant news, introduce innovative learning
   materials, or create social media content related to the subject field
   for broader audiences. Surveys with quantitative and qualitative
   measures, along with instructor journaling, were used to assess
   students' perceived empowerment and to identify specific highlights and
   challenges from both students' and the instructor's perspectives. The
   results indicate that students find authentic ways to voice themselves
   through contributing to collective learning in formats aligning with
   their skills and comfort and perceive a stronger sense of empowerment
   afterwards. The findings contribute to the discourse on student voice
   implementation by highlighting the significance of varied participation
   formats in empowering students to develop adaptive leadership and boost
   engagement and agency in higher education.},

Title = {Digital Environments of Education 4.0 and complex thinking:
   Communicative Literacy to close the digital gender gap},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA IN EDUCATION},

Abstract = {The gender digital divide (GDD) is a social phenomenon that denies
   citizens access to technologies, the internet, and the services
   associated with Education 4.0. Reducing this gap requires communicative
   literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to
   create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual
   environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that
   focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological
   world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical
   principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which
   emphasize the use of technology, self -determined learning, and
   collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the
   participation of 124 Mexican students of technical -professional
   education. The study's objective was to analyze how they scaled their
   communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative
   experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in
   digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico.
   Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic
   thinking (z = -2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly
   higher mean ( M = 25.36) than men ( M = 25.11). Qualitative results
   support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as
   participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90\%).
   This suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively
   enhance communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they
   can be spaces where both women and men achieve similar levels of digital
   literacy.},

Title = {Educating Healthcare Students: Strategies to Teach Systems Thinking to
   Prepare New Healthcare Graduates},

Abstract = {Background: Educating undergraduate healthcare students is challenging
   due to the complexity of the healthcare environment today. Healthcare
   education systems focus mainly on discipline specific thinking using
   linear frameworks and reductionist approaches. Education of nurses,
   pharmacists, physicians, social workers, respiratory therapists takes
   place in a siloed environment with minimal interprofessional
   interaction. Yet, organizations expect new graduates to have skills and
   understanding of collaborative care with knowledge of healthcare systems
   thinking, IPP, Team STEPPS (R), methods of group dynamics, and a
   knowledge of Informatics when they enter the workforce.
   Purpose: The purpose of this article is to 1) discuss and describe
   challenges in a high-tech complex healthcare environment that
   necessitate teaching systems thinking to future healthcare students, and
   2) describe the use of interprofessional education (IPE),
   interprofessional practice (IPP), Team STEPPS (R), curricular content,
   and other teaching methods as strategies for teaching systems thinking.
   Conclusion: Systems thinking in healthcare supports a holistic approach
   to care, inclusive of high-tech in the complex environment. With the
   rapid changes it is necessary to modify our teaching theories we use to
   educate new healthcare providers. Educating and practicing the key
   concepts/principles of IPE, IPP, and TeamSTEPPS, and group dynamics,
   along with the important integration of technology, can provide the
   foundation to develop systems thinking and critical thinking in our
   complex healthcare environment.},

   from the UTAUT2 model in vocational education},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAR 7},
Abstract = {Integrating advanced technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and
   Augmented Reality (AR) in educational settings can significantly enhance
   learning, especially in vocational education, where practical
   application is crucial. However, understanding the factors influencing
   student acceptance of these technologies remains challenging. This study
   examines how Heutagogical and Cybergogical Behaviors affect vocational
   high school students' intentions to use AR and VR in classrooms, with
   Virtual Experience as a mediator. By extending the UTAUT2 model, the
   research offers insights into technology adoption in vocational
   education. Conducted in July 2024 with 438 students from six Indonesian
   regencies, the study used a quantitative, non-experimental design.
   PLS-SEM analysis revealed that Heutagogical and Cybergogical activities
   significantly influenced students' performance and effort expectancy,
   increasing their intention to use AR and VR. Virtual Experience fully
   mediated the effects of performance expectancy, hedonic motivation,
   social influence, and price value on students' intentions. However,
   effort expectancy and facilitating conditions directly impacted
   behavioral intentions, underscoring the importance of ease of use and
   support in adopting these technologies. The findings suggest that
   integrating structured and self-directed learning approaches, providing
   immersive hands-on opportunities with AR/VR tools, and ensuring ease of
   use and strong institutional support can enhance technology adoption.
   These strategies align vocational training with industry demands,
   preparing students for technologically driven workplaces.},

Abstract = {Individuals who are 50 years or older are the largest growing
   demographic among adult learners. However, we still are in the initial
   stages of investigating their attitudes and anxieties regarding specific
   areas of study. The current study explored differences between 92
   younger (26-49 years) and older (50+ years) nontraditional-aged,
   degree-seeking undergraduate and graduate students' attitudes and
   anxieties regarding statistics and research. The Attitudes Toward
   Research (ATR) and Statistics Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS) scales were
   completed via an online survey. Younger nontraditional-aged students
   generally expressed significantly higher anxiety and more negative
   beliefs regarding both statistics and research than their older
   counterparts. Differences were not explained by level of study nor by
   related experience. Results are discussed in relation to further
   consideration of student- and cohort-centered applications of
   andragogical and heutagogical principles for targeted educational
   practices.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the perceptions and
   perspectives of students with regards to self-determined learning in an
   entrepreneurship education (EE) context and its potential contribution
   to employability.
   Design/methodology/approach This research used a mixed-methods approach
   with a sample of 25 students currently attending a UK higher education
   institute. The students had access to participation in EE modules but
   self-determined learning-informed modules or programmes were not
   currently offered. Students were invited to attend focus groups and as a
   result of emergent themes, a business school-wide survey was developed.
   Findings This research makes two tentative contributions to the EE
   field. First, the findings of this student cohort are similar to those
   found throughout the UK and the EU with regard to the perception of the
   value of a degree by students; its contribution to the hidden
   curriculum; and the importance of practical experience. The research
   also adds to the field by considering the value of a self-determined
   learning approach to developing the capabilities and competencies of
   graduates. This approach to learning in a context of EE was in general
   well received by potential students, particularly the applied aspect of
   the programme. However, there is a perception of risk about this
   approach to learning and students are concerned about the value of a
   programme like this to employers in general.
   Originality/value The study contributes to discussions on the value of
   EE on perceived employability and in particular self-determined learning
   through entrepreneurship activity.},

Abstract = {Under the framework of self-determination theory, choice is a supporting
   factor for autonomy in the classroom. The provision of choice in the
   classroom is a distinct feature of higher education, through which
   students experience a shift from mandatory tasks to those are more
   learner-controlled. This study explores Chinese master's students'
   perspectives on choice and the relationship between choice and
   motivation, also, compares the choice-making opportunities in different
   learning contexts (China vs. UK). 60 Chinese master's students, studying
   in China and the UK, participated in this study. The findings of this
   study indicate that most master's students hold a positive attitude
   towards classroom choice, considering choice contributes to increased
   learning motivation in the classroom in most cases. Then, limited
   choices may not automatically decrease students' motivation and students
   studying in China possess fewer opportunities for choice-making than
   students in the UK, which is influenced by the social and academic
   culture.},

Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {As blended learning (BL) is becoming a new normal in the context of
   higher education, there is a growing need to attune pedagogies to this
   context. As reflective blogs were found to be supportive of pre-service
   student teachers' (PSTs') as well as teacher educators' (TEs')
   professional development, the current study aimed to explore PSTs' and
   TEs' perceptions regarding the potential of integrating blogs into the
   BL modality. Applying a qualitative approach, analyses of 528 PSTs' blog
   posts, transcriptions of two focus groups with 11 PSTs, and 3 TEs'
   reflections and discussion transcripts yielded four themes that related
   to both the PSTs' and the TEs' perspectives regarding the integration of
   blogs into BL: (1) keeping sequential learning, (2) supporting
   self-directed learning, (3) keeping a sense of a learning community, and
   (4) increasing motivation and critical thinking. Nevertheless, both the
   PSTs and TEs described unique roles for blogging in BL. The TEs
   indicated that blogs support a sense of control, reveal misconceptions,
   and model teaching, while the PSTs indicated that blogs increase or
   decrease self-confidence during BL. The implications pertain to the
   contribution of blogging in BL, as well as to the four pedagogical
   principles of effective BL design: (a) continuity in learning, (b)
   fostering autonomous learning, (c) building a learning community, and
   (d) reflectivity and professional development.},

Title = {Impact of guided self-study on learning success in undergraduate
   physiotherapy students in Switzerland - a feasibility study of a higher

Abstract = {Background: Guided self-study (G-SS) can be used as a self-directed
   learning method or self-determined learning that fosters changes in
   knowledge and skills in a higher physiotherapy education setting. Until
   now, there has been no empirical evidence for the use of G-SS in higher
   physiotherapy education. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility
   to establish a G-SS program in a fulltime undergraduate physiotherapy
   degree course. In addition, the effectiveness of the G-SS was assessed
   on changes in knowledge and skills.
   Method: Fifty-one first-semester physiotherapy students were randomly
   divided into a G-SS group or control group (CG). The G-SS group received
   six clinical cases. Each case was processed in an eight-day cycle. One
   week in advance, the clinical case were provided to the students
   electronically (day 1). The students prepared the cases in groups and
   were guided by the tutor during this preparation time (day 2 to 7).
   Group work results were presented and reflected on during a moderated
   plenum session at day 8. A priori criteria of success were defined based
   on empirical experience for the primary outcome parameters i) exposure,
   ii) responsiveness of students and iii) program differentiation. The
   secondary outcome was the total score in the objective structured
   clinical examination (OSCE) and written exams. Statistical analyses were
   conducted using SPSS.
   Results: The responsiveness of students as willing to participate in the
   G-SS program was 23\%, clearly below the a priori set 83\%. No
   differences in program differentiation were found. G-SS as compared to
   the CG scored significantly better on OSCE (p = 0.003) and on the
   written exam (p = 0.004).
   Conclusion: The results showed that this higher education G-SS program
   in its current form was not feasible. Slight modification of the study
   protocol (e.g. better time planning in the academic calendar) is needed
   to improve the student's responsiveness. The adjustments to the
   timetable must allow the physiotherapy students to prepare the clinical
   cases under conditions of lower workload. G-SS has the potential to
   promote change in knowledge and skills in undergraduate physiotherapy
   students when students prepare and present the clinical case solutions
   and reflect upon their actions.},

Abstract = {Open and Distance Learning (ODL) has a long history, one marked by the
   emergence of open universities, which was a critical development in the
   ecology of openness. Open universities have taken on significant local
   and global roles within the framework of meeting the needs of their
   respective regions of influence, and as such, their roles have evolved
   over time. Against this background, the purpose of this research is to
   explore the open university phenomenon by examining the case of Anadolu
   University in Turkey, a mega university that has transformed into what
   is now a giga university. More specifically, the research first looks at
   openness in education and how the concept itself has led to the
   emergence of open universities, before turning attention to Anadolu
   University, which is a dual-mode, state university with around 3 million
   enrolled students. Other issues that are addressed as part of this
   research include the rise of ODL and how it positioned itself within
   Turkish higher education; the historical development of Anadolu
   University and its massiveness, in terms of student numbers and services
   provided; local and global ODL practices; learner profiles, learning
   materials and spaces; exams and assessment and evaluation processes;
   learner support services, and Anadolu University's contribution, as an
   open university, to the field of ODL. The research shows that as an open
   university, Anadolu University has narrowed the information gap and
   digital divide, has enhanced equality of opportunity in education, and
   has provided lifelong learning opportunities. More importantly, as an
   institution that has gone beyond the conventional understanding of an
   open university, Anadolu University serves as a catalyst of change and
   innovation in its emergence as a role model for other higher education
   institutions. The following recommendations were able to be developed
   from the examinations of this study: (1) develop a definition of
   ``openness{''} based on the changing paradigms of the 21st century and
   online learning, (2) enter into national and international
   collaborations between open universities, (3) adopt culturally relevant
   open pedagogies, (4) develop and design heutagogy-based curricula, and
   (5) unbundle ODL services in mega and giga universities.},

Title = {AFFORDANCES IN EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY: PERCEPTIONS OF TEACHERS AND
   STUDENTS IN OMAN},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {931-952},
Abstract = {Aim/Purpose This study of affordances in educational technology focuses
   on how the selfperceptions of teachers influence the creation of
   educational opportunities and how these are received by learners.
   Background It is important to explore the affordances offered by
   teachers, when using educational technology, from the perspective of
   their students. Within this topic, the interface of the educational
   technology affordances with the two agents-teachers and students-has
   often been neglected. Hence, the learning possibilities in educational
   interactions for the learners cannot be separated from the interactional
   possibilities created by teachers. The extent to which teachers can
   create opportunities to address their students' needs, while effectively
   conveying the value of these opportunities to their students, is likely
   to impact on how well these affordances for learning and collaboration
   are utilised.
   Methodology A survey that includes two questionnaires was used. The
   questionnaires were circulated to 102 teachers and their 354 adult
   students in six higher education institutions in Oman. The
   questionnaires were analysed by SPSS Amos v20 for statistical measures
   such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation.
   Contribution The study contributes to the field of e-learning because it
   demonstrates that the affordances offered by teachers for e-learning
   have an impact on the possibilities for students to engage. Both
   affordances were found to be highly correlated statistically. Further,
   teachers were found to primarily use the lowest level of engagement for
   online tasks, requiring low levels of cognitive challenge and social
   involvement from the learner.
   Findings The results indicate a low to medium level of self-directed
   learning that significantly correlates with perceptions of teaching
   possibilities for learning interactions.
   Recommendations for Practitioners Teachers are encouraged to vary
   approaches to student engagement in online teaching materials such as
   enhancement, additional engagement opportunities, and extension so that
   students are encouraged to use different cognitive abilities and
   capabilities to engage in social interactions.
   Impact on Society
   This study presents a strong recommendation with regards to extending
   the online affordances towards social interactions of learning beyond
   the boundary of the classroom.
   Future Research Further studies on e-heutagogy and affordances of both
   teachers and students are needed. The effect of teachers created
   opportunities on students learning actions is an area that grants
   further investigation.},

Abstract = {Given the rise of social media engagement within society, there are
   challenges for tutors in blended and online contexts to provide
   opportunities for social constructivist learning experiences within
   their institutional learning environments. This article proposes a
   module approach to teaching, learning and assessment for learners
   undertaking part-time, vocationally related degrees. A mixed methods
   approach was adopted to conduct a detailed exploration of eight tutors'
   practice with data gathered from three principal sources. Interviews
   with tutors explored their approaches to delivery and considered factors
   that impacted on quality; students' perceptions of their learning
   experiences were assessed using an attitude survey; and an analysis of
   the content and communications in the virtual learning environment
   provided insight into tutors' online practice. Analysis of modules
   suggested limited online peer-to-peer interaction, with tutors noting
   the difficulties of promoting engagement. The article argues for a
   constructivist approach in this context with a need for tutors to
   promote a simple module structure, focused around assessment, that
   creates space for learning. This structure appeared appropriate for
   these learners, enabling them to manage the influence of daily events,
   together with pressures and time constraints of work. The findings could
   aid tutors in designing and delivering courses for similar groups of
   learners.},

Abstract = {This article shows how the self-determined learning environment in
   Paths, an innovative teacher-education (TE) program, enables students to
   experience meaningful learning which reinforces their mental wellbeing
   and resilience. According to the self-determination theory (SDT), a
   central goal of such a learning environment is to support students'
   three basic emotional and social needs of self-capacity, autonomy, and
   relatedness and connections with others. While the Paths program trains
   the students to be high-school teachers, and coaches them to be mentors
   for youth at risk (YAR), about half of these students define themselves
   as having been YAR who suffered from a low level of resilience and
   mental wellbeing in their adolescence. Using the self-determined
   learning environment, Paths fosters students as self-determined learners
   in many courses which use methods like Project-Based Learning (PBL),
   Self-Determined Learning (Heutagogy), Outdoor Training (ODT), and
   Self-Management Learning (SML). In keeping with the qualitative
   multiple-case study method, semi-structured interviews with four Paths
   graduates and examples of other graduates' learning presentations
   demonstrated that graduates' learning experiences supported their
   emotional and social needs and strengthened their feelings of resilience
   and mental wellbeing during and after the learning. The graduates
   testified that this learning environment helped them to become
   entrepreneurs and empowering educators, as well as social and
   environmental activists. These findings reveal the productive
   contribution of the self-determined learning environment to students'
   development as teachers and YAR mentors, and as social and environmental
   leaders.},

Title = {Acceptance of Social Media for Study Purposes-A Longitudinal Case Study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Background: Social media is a ubiquitous phenomenon that serves as a
   tool for communication, collaboration, and creativity. In the long term,
   it has an indispensable place in the field of education. The research
   paper discusses the use of certain social networking sites where
   learning management systems are extensively and consistently used in the
   teaching and learning process at universities. The rapid transition to
   online platforms had a tremendous impact on the educational process,
   exposing and promoting the effectiveness of heutagogy. The circumstances
   made it necessary to emphasize the value of self-directed learning and
   the capacity to identify educational requirements and strategies for
   reaching study objectives. This kind of research corresponds to the
   increased need to develop desired self-study skills in students.
   Objectives: The goal of the paper is to demonstrate how undergraduate
   students perceive the trends in acceptance and the degree of
   appropriateness of social media for academic purposes. Methods: Research
   on social media use in education was inspired by a review of the
   literature. The purpose of the questionnaire is to track awareness, use,
   general satisfaction, communication, testing, and revision. The set of
   social media examined in the survey (years 2021 and 2022) was modified
   to reflect the social media landscape at the time. This study compares
   the findings of four different studies. The outcomes are displayed in
   graphs. Results: Two areas are analyzed: social media as a means of
   communication in the process of education and social media as a tool
   enabling students' revision and testing of study materials. The first
   two studies, which were conducted in 2014 and 2019, are based on the
   same set of examined social media and fit the comparison, enabling to
   define the trend in students' perceived satisfaction with social media
   for study purposes. The third and fourth studies discussed in this paper
   were run during the winter semesters of 2021 and 2022. Conclusions: The
   most significant differences between 2021 and 2022 can be seen in
   Instagram, Twitch, and other platforms, where a substantial drop in
   satisfaction in the communication field can be seen. The biggest
   difference in revision and testing is found in Facebook, Twitch, and
   Teams, which are abandoning online teaching and learning after the
   COVID-19 event. Social media use for studying has significantly
   decreased, with noteworthy decreases in Wiki, Facebook, and video calls.},

Title = {Impact of guided self-study on learning success in undergraduate
   physiotherapy students - a study protocol for a randomized controlled
   feasibility trial},

Abstract = {Background: Self-directed learning or self-determined learning can be
   used in guided self-study (GSS) as an educational method with the goal
   to promote changes in the knowledge and skills of undergraduate
   physiotherapy students in higher education. Until now, there has been a
   lack of empirical evidence for the usage of GSS in physiotherapy higher
   education. At the Division of Physiotherapy in the Department of Health
   Professions (Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH), Switzerland) the
   module `basic examination' - in the form of an objective structured
   examination (OSCE) and written exam - is scheduled in the first semester
   of the educational program.
   Objective: The primary aim of this study is to examine the feasibility
   of establishing GSS in an undergraduate physiotherapy degree program at
   the BFH. Secondary aim is to assess the effectiveness of GSS on the
   examination skills of first-semester undergraduate physiotherapy
   students will.
   Method: This paper describes the protocol of a randomized
   group-controlled educational feasibility study. 51 physiotherapy
   students from the first semester will be allocated into a guided
   self-study group (GSSG) or control group. The GSS takes place during the
   first semester, and consists of an eight-day cycle, with a presentation
   on the last day. Duration of this presentation is 90min with supervision
   from a university lecturer. One week in advance of the presentation, the
   case and the learning goals are provided to the students electronically.
   The students prepare the cases in groups of five to six. The students
   are guided by the tutor during this preparation time. During a moderated
   plenum session, students present the results of group work and reflect
   upon the preparation phase and learning steps. Feasibility outcomes
   include the fidelity of implementation through exposure dosage,
   students' responsiveness, program differentiation, and the degree of
   acceptability. Success criteria of feasibility are (1) exposure dosage
   as the number of 90-minute presentations that are conducted, and the
   content of cases and competences, (2) students' responsiveness, with the
   aim of 100\% willingness to participate, and (3) program
   differentiation, which will illustrate the alignment between GSS case
   content and the curriculum. Acceptability of intervention from the
   students' perspective will be evaluated by a semi-structured interview.
   Secondary outcomes will be the achieved grades in the OSCE exams and
   written exams that demonstrate learning success.
   Conclusion: This feasibility study assesses the fidelity of
   implementation, the degree of acceptability and the effectiveness of GSS
   sessions on examination skills in undergraduate physiotherapy students
   at the BFH. Furthermore, this study will demonstrate whether guided
   self-study is feasible and can be implemented with fidelity in the BFH
   physiotherapy higher education curriculum.},

Title = {Enhancing learner affective engagement: The impact of instructor
   emotional expressions and vocal charisma in asynchronous video-based
   online learning},

Abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of higher education and adult
   learning, asynchronous video-based online learning has not only become
   the new norm but has also emerged as the cornerstone of instructional
   delivery for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Despite its widespread
   adoption, this learning mode confronts a critical challenge: the
   inherent lack of social presence, posing a significant risk of
   diminishing learner affective engagement and, consequently, jeopardizing
   the efficacy of learning outcomes. Addressing this pressing issue, our
   study conducted a comprehensive analysis of 240 instructional videos
   from 240 distinct instructors on a MOOC platform, supplemented by 845
   post-course learner feedback surveys from a diverse cohort of college
   students and adult learners. Using deep learning and statistical
   analysis, the research revealed that the on-screen presence of
   instructors does not inherently affect students' affective engagement.
   The study revealed that learners' affective engagement is affected by
   distinct combinations of the instructor's facial and paraverbal
   expressions, including happiness, surprise, and anger, which vary
   depending on whether the instructor is visible. The discovery that vocal
   attractiveness is a pivotal element in enhancing learners' affective
   engagement with instructional videos marks a paradigm shift in our
   understanding of digital andragogy and heutagogy. This study propels
   academic discourse by illuminating the critical role of instructor
   non-verbal cues in establishing social presence and facilitating
   emotional contagion within asynchronous video-based online learning but
   also provides educators and content creators with empirically-backed
   techniques to revolutionize video instruction and amplify affective
   engagement.},

Abstract = {Universities play a crucial role in building the economic development
   capacity for their communities and regions. Their capacity building role
   is typically defined by contributions to the economic bottom line of the
   community and region where a university is located. This kind of
   capacity building may find itself in conflict with the long-term
   sustainable development needs of the region and with the responsibility
   of the university itself. Sustainable capacity building may require
   strategies that focus on the specific social, cultural, environmental,
   and physical context of a university's location beyond purely economic
   capacity goals. To achieve sustainable development outcomes,
   universities must advance an understanding of the context conditions
   within which they are located. At least three context systems are
   relevant to this view of development: the economy, society and culture,
   and the environment with its physical, biological, and ecological
   context conditions. Each of these context systems is characterized by
   distinct time frames, spatial configurations, rules, and success
   measures. A focus on economic development outcomes reflects only one
   subsystem's rules, behaviors, and success measures. By analyzing two
   case study examples from the United States and South Africa, we offer a
   framework for universities to advance sustainability objectives that
   correspond to their broader responsibilities. We argue that in order to
   meet these broader responsibilities, universities must first commit to
   giving expression to their own local context through the voices and
   lived realities of students and residents. Since universities build the
   brain trust of communities and regions around the world, they play an
   essential role in strengthening global sustainability goals by building
   the local capacity of their communities and regions.},

Abstract = {TVET in Malaysia is geared toward providing quality education, training,
   and resources but it still needs to be strengthened and reformed toward
   producing a more quality and skilled workforce. This study aimed to
   procure feedback from TVET curriculum key-players' (automotive) on the
   integration of automotive case-based simulation (CBS) as TVET future
   learning strategies. Collective case-study research design was used with
   purposive sampling design which involved 5 curriculum key-players in
   vocational college and 16 automotive industries as study respondents. A
   set of questionnaires and interview protocols were used to gather
   quantitative and qualitative data. Intra-class correlation coefficient
   (ICC) was used to obtain an average measure agreement among raters.
   ATLAS.ti was also used through thematic analysis to produce models. The
   ICC showed high values of agreement for the process and structure of the
   CBS. The limitation of this research focused on one program (automotive
   technology) through the key-players' and industries' perspectives toward
   the implementation of CBS as a tool to enhance students' soft skills.
   The collation of both data showed the alignment between both parties
   against the CBS. The curriculum key-players agreed that CBS fulfilled
   its requirements as a tool to enrich TVET students' marketability
   skills, supported by the automotive industries' perspective which
   believed that using CBS would prepare TVET students' readiness to the
   workplace. Notably, the CBS provides an opportunity to stimulate
   thinking and learning preferences among students, in addition to being a
   learning tool for future TVET learning strategies that connect theory
   and practice in preparation for job training.},

Abstract = {Purpose To date, didactic lecturing is a common method of university
   medical training. However, higher levels of competence to solve complex
   issues are hardly to be achieved with a largely passive learning style.
   We established and evaluated a heutagogical blended learning concept to
   investigate self-determined learning with a multimedia-based,
   interactive approach in the lecture room to teach clinical radiology.
   Materials and Methods In the 2019/2020 winter semester, we included 266
   medical students in their fourth academic year in our prospective,
   observational study. Students participated in a series of 11
   radiological lectures given by 10 lecturers. They were requested to
   prepare for lectures by watching learning videos. During the lecture,
   students had to answer key-feature questions (KFQ) in small groups and
   to jointly submit their answers by means of an audience response system
   (ARS). After each lecture and the exam, we conducted surveys and
   compared results with a historical control group. A focus group
   interview with lecturers was performed after conclusion of the lecture
   series.
   Results The students' overall impression of the ``flipped classroom{''}
   concept and their examination grades were superior to historical
   controls (overall impression: 1.5 {[}95 \% CI 1.4-1.6] vs. 2.7 {[}95 \%
   CI 2.5-2.9] rated on a scale from 1 to 6, p < 0.001; examination grades:
   1.8 {[}95 \% CI 1.7-1.9] vs. 2.0 {[} 95 \% CI 1.9-2.0] rated on a scale
   from 1 to 5, p < 0.001). Most students agreed that learning videos (76.6
   \%), ARS ( 88.5 \%), KFQ (76.5 \%), and solution-oriented small group
   discussions (83.7 \%) were useful. Lecturers stated an improved
   convergence of demands on learning and clinical competence. However,
   they also emphasized an increased initial effort for implementation.
   Conclusion Students rated the overall benefit from the heutagogical
   ``flipped classroom{''} concept as high. Examination grades improved.
   According to lecturers, the ``flipped classroom{''} concept better
   matched later professional demands than traditional lectures.},

Title = {Planning and Implementation of Guided Self-study in an Undergraduate
   Physiotherapy Curriculum in Switzerland-A Feasibility Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Self-directed learning (andragogy) or self-determined
   learning (heutagogy) can be implemented in guided self-study (GSS) with
   the aim to foster changes in the knowledge and skills of physiotherapy
   students in a higher education setting. To date, there is a lack of
   evidence for the use of GSS in higher education for physiotherapy.
   Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of developing and
   implementing GSS in an undergraduate physiotherapy educational program
   in Switzerland. In addition, the effectiveness of GSS in bringing
   changes in knowledge and skills was assessed.
   Method: Full-time undergraduate physiotherapy students (n = 49) from the
   third semester volunteered in this feasibility study. Students were
   randomly allocated into a GSS group or a control group (CG) in the
   period from October to November 2019. The GSS group prepared a total of
   3 clinical cases. Each case was processed in an 8-day cycle. On day 1,
   the clinical case (ie, description of a patient and symptoms) and
   learning goals were provided to the students electronically. The
   students prepared the cases in groups from days 2 to 7. They were guided
   2 times by the tutor (physical meeting and via Skype) during this
   preparation phase. The results of group work were presented and
   reflected on during a moderated plenum session (90 minutes) on day 8.
   The feasibility of this higher education study was operationalized as
   follows: exposure ({''}dose,{''} ie, the number of GSS sessions
   performed over 90 minutes, as well as the content of the cases and the
   learning objectives); students' responsiveness, with an a priori set
   100\% willingness to participate on day 8; program differentiation, to
   illustrate differences between the content of GSS cases and the
   curriculum; and degree of acceptability. In addition, an assessment was
   made of the total scores in the objective structured clinical
   examination (OSCE) and written examinations, as well as the amount of
   GSS. Statistical analyses were conducted using an intention-to-treat
   approach.
   Results: All 3 GSS sessions on day 8 lasted the scheduled 90 minutes.
   The content of the presented cases was aligned with the learning
   objectives. The responsiveness of students willing to participate on day
   8 was 42\%. In program differentiation, no differences in content were
   found between the GSS presentation content and the usual curriculum
   content when compared with the learning aims. Objective structured
   clinical examination grades and written examination grades were similar
   for the GSS and CG. The analysis of the focus group interview showed a
   low degree of acceptability indicating that the students' workload was
   high during the GSS period.
   Conclusions: This study showed that this GSS program for undergraduate
   physiotherapy students in its current form is ``feasible with
   modification.{''} Modification of the study protocol (eg, better time
   planning in the academic calendar) is needed to improve the students'
   responsiveness. Alternatively, classroom hours may be reduced to favor
   self-study time. Such adjustments to the timetable should allow the
   physiotherapy students to better prepare the clinical cases. The
   effectiveness of the GSS and normal curriculum on OSCE and written
   examination scores was similar, probably due to the observed low
   students' acceptability},

Title = {Are undergraduate students studying smart? Insights into study
   strategies and habits across a programme of study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The approach that students take in their studies at university is
   critical not only for their academic success but is equally important in
   life-long learning for their career and professional development.
   Heutagogy is the study of self-determined learning and it is important
   that we appraise how students in higher education are developing their
   metacognitive awareness in how they learn and study effectively.
   Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary research area that involves
   the scientific study of the human mind. It helps provide new knowledge
   in relation to areas such as memory, problem solving, knowledge transfer
   and understanding of complex topics. Cognitive science has demonstrated
   that re-testing oneself on material when learning, enhances and promotes
   greater retention of knowledge compared to re-reading the material.
   Learning that is distributed or spaced out over multiple study sessions
   also allows for greater retention of knowledge in the longer-term
   compared to `cramming' of information. To evaluate the use of effective
   study approaches and habits across three different levels of study in an
   undergraduate pharmacy programme, a survey study was employed. A
   paper-based survey was completed by first-, second- and third-year
   undergraduate pharmacy students (n=192) during class sessions. Although
   there was some evidence of metacognitive awareness such as using testing
   (retrieval practice) with practice problems; across all years,
   suboptimal study approaches such as rereading, copying notes and
   cramming were endorsed. A schedule of deadlines shaped the organisation
   of study and time management for most students. Self-testing was
   predominantly used to test learning rather than an approach used during
   learning. There was evidence of a difference between the cohorts in
   relation to decisions for prioritizing studying, returning to review
   course material and re-reading. The evidence from this study
   demonstrates that learners would require training on metacognitive
   awareness and effective study strategies to enable their self-determined
   learning capabilities to evolve. The linear progression through a
   programme of study alone will not achieve this. There is a need to embed
   and emphasize effective strategies for learning into curricula and for
   faculty to utilise metacognitive awareness in their teaching.
   Practitioner Notes
   1. Self-determined learning places an expectation that learners
   self-regulate and take responsibility for their learning. Student's
   independent study within a programme helps to consolidate learning.
   2. Study habits and preferences vary among individuals however there is
   clear evidence from cognitive science that not all study approaches are
   effective.
   3. Undergraduate students are using suboptimal study methods such as
   rereading notes, recopying notes and cramming information the night
   before a test. Self-testing was predominantly used to test learning
   rather than an approach used during learning.
   4. Students report that they are not using approaches taught to them by
   teachers. It has been shown that learners incorrectly predict suboptimal
   methods as superior to evidencebased approaches. We suggest that
   evidence-based study approaches are explicitly emphasised and embedded
   within courses.
   5. We recommend to senior managers with learning and teaching remits
   (Directors of Learning and Teaching, Pro Vice-Chancellors for Education
   and Student Experience) that faculty staff are informed about
   evidence-based learning approaches from cognitive science and increase
   metacognitive awareness in their teaching.},
