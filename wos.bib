Abstract = {Mobile Heutagogy (M-Heutagogy) is the teaching practice that emphasizes
   self-determined learning and student autonomy. Many teachers and
   academicians have applied M-Heutagogy in their teaching and learning in
   Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The purpose of this study is to
   synthesize an empirical literature review of the M-Heutagogical practice
   among Higher Education students and its acceptance. The main objective
   of this paper is to review the literature on M-Heutagogy practice and
   its acceptance among Higher Education students. The researcher conducted
   a systematic review of 60 articles for the period 2007 to 2020. The
   findings indicate that M-Heutagogy has been applied in HEIs around the
   world with the support of emergent technologies and mobile applications.
   Unfortunately, only two M-Heutagogy acceptance studies have been done so
   far. Future research suggested that the M-Heutagogy acceptance model
   should be developed to be referred by researchers while doing an
   acceptance study.},

Title = {`Nice to Meet You Again': When Heutagogy Met Blended Learning in Teacher
   Education, Post-Pandemic Era},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Heutagogy and blended learning (BL) are core concepts in the educational
   discourse post-COVID-19. Conducting a mixed-methods study, we
   investigate meeting points between heutagogy principles and BL in the
   context of curricular change in the academic timetable of teacher
   education college, where pre-COVID most courses have been taught
   face-to-face (F2F). At present, teacher educators and students meet F2F
   for three weeks, followed by a week of remote learning, combining
   synchronous and asynchronous pedagogies. Data have been collected by a
   closed-ended questionnaire and two focus groups, involving altogether 76
   lecturers and 553 students. Findings indicate that heutagogy has been
   applied in all facets of BL, rather than only with online or digital
   technological components. This study explores a bottom-up growth of
   heutagogy expressions in BL at three meeting points. When the core
   facets of heutagogy principles have been identified, there has been a
   predominance of the students' agency and life-long learners, together
   with facets such as a non-linear learning and capability development
   that have been underrepresented. This study contributes to the research
   field of heutagogy in teacher education as it identifies the meaning and
   the way a structural change in the curriculum can constitute an
   accelerator and catalyst when implementing heutagogy in practice.},

Title = {The dynamic mix of heutagogy and technology: Preparing learners for
   lifelong learning},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1629-1645},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With the swift pivot to online learning, teachers and students have been
   forced to adopt a new way of teaching and learning, which has required
   students to become more self-directed in their learning. In addition,
   teachers are faced with the challenge of preparing students for the
   workforce and lifelong learning. One emerging approach for addressing
   both these challenges is that of heutagogy, or self-determined learning.
   This paper discusses the rising demand for lifelong learning skills and
   the role that heutagogy can play in supporting students in developing
   self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Specifically, the paper
   presents a case study of a higher education institution that has
   introduced heutagogy, using interviews with programme
   leaders/instructors to investigate how a college in Israel incorporated
   heutagogy into their master's education programmes. Case study results
   reveal that there are challenges in incorporating heutagogy (eg,
   difficulty for students in adopting the approach), but once adopted,
   students preferred learning in a self-determined way.
   Practitioner notes
   What is already known about this topic?
   Lifelong learning skills are critical to student employability, and
   there is a need for exploring new theories and approaches for developing
   these skills.
   The current pandemic has forced traditional learning into the online
   space, requiring more self-directed learning skills in learners.
   Heutagogy has been identified as a net-centric teaching and learning
   theory for online learning.
   What this paper adds
   Positions heutagogy for use in traditional and online classroom settings
   in order to develop learners' self-directed and lifelong learning
   skills.
   Explores the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum and its use as an
   instructional strategy.
   Presents a case study of a higher education institution that has
   implemented self-determined learning.
   Implications for practice and/or policy
   This study encourages further research into use of heutagogy for
   developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills.
   This study provides guidance for those who want to introduce
   self-determined learning into classroom settings.},

Abstract = {The covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the way teachers and students
   interact in the classroom. The pedagogy approach has been pushed to
   transform into Andragogy. Current research aims to investigate the
   student experiences with the andragogy approach and its potential impact
   on students' self-regulated learning. Andragogy, heutagogy, peeragogy,
   and cybergogy principles used by the teacher as part of distance
   learning during the pandemic will be modelled to check their effect on
   the student's self-regulated learning. The results show that andragogy,
   heutagogy, cybergogy, and peeragogy have significant effects on
   self-regulated learning. Andragogy is proven to be based on heutagogy,
   peeragogy, and cybergogy since it has a strong effect on these 3
   approaches. The least path coefficient among them is shown by the path
   between andragogy and cybergogy. Andragogy also has a significant
   indirect effect on self-regulated learning through the approaches. The
   results may lead to a conclusion that andragogy, heutagogy, cybergogy,
   and peeragogy can be used as an effective way to improve the student
   self-regulated learning.},

Abstract = {Heutagogy-also known as self-determined learning-empowers individuals to
   take charge of their personal growth by fostering proactive approaches
   to self-development. In a Christian context, self-enacted spiritual

   expressions of the role and work of the Holy Spirit in capacitating
   Christian discipleship. This conceptual paper contributes to the
   literature by expounding and advocating heutagogy as an
   under-appreciated framework for facilitating spiritual growth. To
   construct its argument, the paper draws on three sources: biblical
   wisdom literature, the teachings of Jesus Christ, and selected
   expressions of the continuing work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of

Title = {Exploring heutagogy in a tertiary coach developer course},
Journal = {SPORT EDUCATION AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {This study explores the challenges of applying heutagogy in a tertiary
   coach education course. It examines (first author) Blake's assumptions
   about heutagogy as a complementary epistemological approach in coach
   education and how these assumptions shaped his teaching in a third-year
   coach developer course. Building on previous research on heutagogy in
   student-coach learning, this study uses self-study methodology to
   provide a nuanced perspective on the challenges of course design and
   implementation. Using the metaphor of flying a plane, the findings
   illustrate the complexities of applying heutagogical principles -
   meticulous planning, unexpected turbulence and in-flight adjustments -
   while navigating the tension between learner autonomy and the structured
   expectations of university settings. The findings suggest that while
   heutagogy encourages adaptability and self-directed learning, practical
   challenges such as maintaining motivation, managing workload and
   aligning expectations require adjustments that balance autonomy with
   structured support over time. This study offers insights into how a
   tertiary-based coach educator navigated institutional constraints,
   student readiness and pedagogical change while responding to calls for
   more learner-centred approaches in tertiary coach and coach developer
   education.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the implementation levels of Heutagogy,
   Peeragogy, and Cybergogy approaches among instructors at vocational
   colleges in Malaysia. Employing a quantitative survey research design,
   data were collected from a sample of 241 instructors across 15
   vocational colleges, representing various Technology fields such as
   Automotive, Electrical, Electronic, Construction, Welding, Industrial
   Machining, Refrigeration \& Air Conditioning, and Computer Systems \&
   Network Technology. The sample was selected using a cluster stratified
   convenient sampling method. Demographic information, including gender,
   age, race, institutional zone, vocational college, program, experience,
   qualification, certificate, and class, was gathered. A structured
   questionnaire comprising 53 items served as the primary data collection
   instrument. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software to derive
   frequency values, percentages, mean scores, and standard deviations. The
   Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were employed to identify
   differences in the implementation of Heutagogy, Peeragogy, and Cybergogy
   approaches among the instructors. The findings indicate a high level of
   implementation for Heutagogy and Peeragogy approaches, while the
   Cybergogy approach is practiced at a moderate level. Significant
   differences were observed in the implementation of these approaches
   based on the instructors' fields and teaching experience. To enhance the
   practice of Cybergogy, it is recommended that vocational college
   administrations provide training workshops or courses to improve the
   teaching skills of their academic staff for 21st st century learning

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Medical education is tricky to imbibe and difficult to
   apply. Various teaching-learning (TL) methods have been tried from time
   to time to enhance the proficiency of students. The aim was to assess
   the students' perception toward three different TL methods (pedagogy,
   andragogy, and heutagogy) in medical education.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparative experimentalquestionnaire-based
   study was done on population of second-year MBBS students of SMS Medical
   College, Jaipur, in October 2019. They were taught topic of anticancer
   drugs using pedagogy, andragogy, and heutagogy methods. Then, their
   opinion regarding these methods was collected and evaluated. The
   reliability of the questionnaire was ascertained by Cronbach's alpha
   value which turned out to be 0.89. The data collected were analyzed
   statistically using one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA).
   RESULTS: The results showed that all these methods differ significantly
   from each other as the P < 0.05 considering 5\% as level of
   significance. PCA revealed that andragogy and heutagogy were found to be
   most effective in this study.
   CONCLUSION: Competency-based andragogy and capability-based heutagogy
   are more effective TL methods than didactic lecture-based pedagogy for
   MBBS undergraduate students.},

Abstract = {Teaching approaches are important in assisting lecturers in efficiently
   planning and delivering their lectures. Technological advancements
   should be applied not just for internet access and communication, but
   also in the teaching and learning (TnL) process. This study was designed
   to develop a website-based E-Module of the heutagogy learning approach
   to improve the teaching and learning process in the Measurement Tools
   Course, Electrical Technology Certificate Program in Community Colleges.
   The proposed E-Module is expected to make the lectures more engaging and
   effective for students. A product design and development approach was
   employed in this study to collect data from 15 respondents, comprising
   five experts and ten lecturers from the Southern Zone Community College.
   The usability of the E-Module in terms of interface design, interaction,
   content, and heutagogy learning approach was assessed through expert
   evaluation forms and user questionnaires. Resultantly, the usability
   evaluation of this E-Module revealed a high degree of agreement in terms
   of interface design, interaction, and content. Respondents also agreed
   that utilizing the heutagogy learning approach is incredibly relevant
   and may improve lecturers' teaching sessions. Nevertheless, larger-scale
   research is needed to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of this
   E-Module of heutagogy learning approach in enhancing students' knowledge

Abstract = {Preparing students for the complex and changing nature of the workforce
   has become an overriding objective within higher education. New
   pedagogies, which incorporate both informal and formal learning and
   support personalization of learning, are central to this objective.
   Educators are required to reassess the use of traditional pedagogies, as
   they attempt to foster development of skills and competencies for
   lifelong learning. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is a learning
   theory that addresses this need, giving students agency in determining
   what and how they learn. The theory is based in the principles of
   learner agency, capability and self-efficacy, reflection and
   metacognition, and non-linear learning, and when used with technology
   can be a powerful instructional approach for building students'
   self-directed and lifelong learning skills. A compelling example of this
   is the e-portfolio. As a platform and assessment tool, the e-portfolio
   spans the spectrum of lifelong learning, as well as encompasses both
   formal and informal learning of the individual learner and addresses
   critical aspects of learning and reflection, showcasing the learner's
   acquired skills and competencies. Based on successful cases in the
   literature, this article discusses the principles of heutagogy, the
   pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH continuum) and its application in
   online learning environments, and the use of the eportfolio in further
   cultivating and advancing self-determined learning. The article also
   offers recommendations for future practice and theory.},

Title = {Heutagogy: A self-determined learning approach for Midwifery Continuity
   of Care experiences{*}},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Aim: The aim of this discussion paper is to discuss learning theories in
   midwifery education, as related to the Midwifery Continuity of Care
   Experience and to propose an original conceptual framework based on
   Heutagogy.Background: Midwifery education curricula include a number of
   midwifery practice experiences. One of the requirements is for students
   to provide Midwifery Continuity of Care. To achieve these experiences,
   students in Australia are required to provide care to at least ten (10)
   women through pregnancy, be on call for the woman's birth and provide at
   least two visits post-birth. Continuity of care experiences appear to
   have been incorporated without sufficient consideration of the
   educational purpose of the experience, or how the experiences contribute
   to the development of the profession. Although we do know midwifery
   practice embraces woman-centred care as its philosophical underpinning,
   a learning approach that is congruent with this philosophy needs to be
   clearly articulated. Design: A discussion paper that compared and
   contrasted learning theories to align with Midwifery Continuity of Care
   experiences. Methods: A review of the literature on learning theories
   was conducted before comparing and contrasting the theories to arrive at
   a conceptual framework focused on learning theory and its application to
   the Midwifery Continuity of Care Experience.Results: Heutagogy provides
   a potentially congruent educational learning approach to underpin the
   continuity of care experiences, in comparison to traditional learning
   theories of pedagogy and andragogy. With a paucity of research in the
   application of heutagogy to midwifery education, it's conceptual
   underpinnings and the possible application to the Continuity of Care
   Experience, this paper explores the possible theoretical applications of
   heutagogy to midwifery education.Conclusion: As a learning theory,
   heutagogy is well aligned with woman-centred care. Heutagogy provides a
   theoretical framework suitable to underpin strategies, including the
   conceptual framework proposed, that may assist in empowering students to
   participate in their own education by giving them the ability to be self
   determined in both their approach to learning and to evaluate their own
   learning needs.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to identify the effects of heutagogy learning
   environment and its effectiveness towards secondary school students'
   creativity in designing English for Second Language (ESL) presentation
   slides. There are two types of items measured; creativity in
   implementing multimedia elements in the slides and creativity in content
   organization and delivery in an ESL lesson. This study uses one group
   pre-test post-test design to determine whether there is a significant
   difference in the creativity of the presentation slides after the
   implementation of the heutagogy learning environment. A total of 10
   respondents were chosen from a Form 3 class in secondary school as the
   sample. Findings show that there are positive outcomes from both items
   measured where creativity in implementing multimedia elements shows
   there is a significant difference before and after the treatment.
   Similarly, there is also a significant difference shown in creativity in
   content organization and delivery. In conclusion, this study could help
   to assist teachers in designing a heutagogy learning environment that
   promotes lifelong learning skills in cultivating creativity which aligns
   with the objectives of the 21st century learning.},

   task To future in a way that includes the voices of an increasingly

   While extensive research is available to inform learning design that is

   a method to capture learners' voices as the experts in their own futures
   and introduce the concept of a Speculative Alignment between those
   futures and learning design. We expect this co-design approach, based on
   speculative design concepts, to support the design of future focussed

Abstract = {This study expatiates on the roles of hand-made illustrations in
   self-determined Igbo cultural education. In simplistic terms, to
   illustrate means to draw or craft images for information passage.
   Totemism is the practice of harmless co-habitation between humans,
   animals, plants and lifeless objects. The Igbo culture is multifarious
   in existential mythologies that seem as doubtful as they are credible.
   Igbo mythology consolidates totemism and axiomatic expressions, thereby
   forming strong philosophical hedges around the people over the
   centuries. This study adopted the desktop qualitative research design.
   The specific objectives of the study were to: ascertain the cultural
   chattels of Igbo totemism and numerology, relive some Igbo axioms and
   mythology through illustrations, and buttress on illustration as
   catalyst for Igbo cultural heutagogy. The instruments for data
   collection and review were: journal articles, books and 53
   researcher-made illustrations exemplified for advancing Igbo cultural
   heutagogy. Histrionic interpretations of axioms were also made.},

   Learning in the Post-COVID Era},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {With the outbreak of COVID-19, online open and distance learning (ODL)
   has become increasingly relevant, particularly among those who aim to
   pursue postgraduate studies. ODL provides an opportunity for many to
   study while working or raising a family. Nevertheless, ODL programs are
   associated with low student engagement and high non-completion rates
   compared to traditional programs. Among the main contributing factors
   are communication and course design, which relate to the level of
   responsiveness of instructors and the quality of course design thus
   delivery through online. An innovative approach is needed to address
   these issues, and heutagogy seems to be a viable alternative.
   Nevertheless, the heutagogical approach alone is incomplete without
   considering the instructional scaffolding technique that can affect
   adult students' engagement. This study introduces a model that combines
   heutagogy and instructional scaffolding (HEIS) as a guideline in
   conducting a fully online ODL course called Technology and Media Design.
   It interrogates the impact of the course design from the perspective of
   postgraduate students and instructors in one of Malaysia's public
   universities. Recommendations include for faculties with ODL courses to
   continuously help develop instructors' competencies and using more
   suitable assessment approaches e.g., project-based.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the utilization of the video game Grand Theft Auto
   as a unique tool within the lecture theatre to develop contemporary
   heutagogy. Drawing upon the authors' personal reflections in the form of
   an autoethnographic account across a four year period, the challenges
   and benefits of utilizing the approach within in-person and virtual
   learning environments is interrogated. Utilizing video games as a means
   to ensure students are active participants whilst learning complex
   theoretical paradigms has proven highly beneficial, aiding in the
   reduction of attainment gaps and wider barriers to learning. So too, the
   approach has enabled cohorts to disentangle criminological problems
   whilst being empowered to question the nature of public criminology
   within contemporary discourse. Active engagement with video games whilst
   in the lecture theatre, by both students and lecturers, has enabled a
   dynamic and inclusive learning environment.},

Title = {Heutagogy as an alternative in teacher education: conceptions of
   lecturers and pre-service teachers of school of education and life-long
   learning, SDD-UBIDS},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Introduction The needs of today's higher education have changed and
   higher education does not need a one-way communication from teacher to
   student but rather learn to appreciate the new role of the teacher as a
   facilitator with mutual responsibilities toward the creation of
   knowledge. Heutagogy, which emphasizes learner autonomy and the creation
   of self-determined learners, has garnered attention as a potential
   solution to address the evolving needs of teacher preparation. However,
   empirical research on the beliefs and attitudes of Heutagogy within the
   teacher education context remains limited. This study aimed to fill this
   gap by exploring the beliefs and attitudes of lecturers and pre-service
   teachers of the School of Education and Life-Long Learning (SoELL) at
   SDD-UBIDS.Methods Convergent mixed method design with both quantitative
   and qualitative data analysis, the study collected both quantitative and
   qualitative data on 513 Pre-service teachers and 30 Lecturers from
   SoELL, SDD-UBIDS using a four-point Likert scale questionnaire and
   interview.Results The findings revealed diverse perspectives among
   Lecturers and Pre-service Teachers regarding Heutagogy, with varying
   levels of understanding, acceptance, and readiness for implementation.
   Lecturers expressed enthusiasm for Heutagogy's potential to foster
   learner autonomy and critical thinking skills, while pre-service
   teachers demonstrated varying levels of readiness and comfort with
   self-directed learning approaches.Discussion Lecturers and Pre-service
   teachers expressed willingness to embrace a self-determined approach in
   which the learner reflects on what is learned and how it is learned and
   where the Lecturers teach the learners how to learn by themselves. The
   cognitive conflict and the inadequacy of pre-service teachers'
   preparedness will necessitate a shift in their attitudes toward
   developing autonomy skills to effectively navigate the challenges of the
   21st-century knowledge economy.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the efficacy of an innovative teaching method
   framework, which incorporated heutagogical techniques and industrial
   case-based learning, in boosting the critical thinking abilities of
   vocational students. Using a pre-and post-test experimental design, 120
   students from three Malaysian vocational colleges were randomly assigned
   to experimental and control groups. The experimental group participated
   in a three-day environmental sustainability and heutagogy-based
   educational camp. Pre- and post-test performance was graded using a
   validated rubric that evaluated analytical, creative, and practical
   thinking skills. Controlling for pre-test performance, Multivariate
   Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) demonstrated a substantial influence of
   the heutagogical method on the post-test scores of the students. These
   findings demonstrate the potential for creative, hands-on teaching
   techniques, such as heutagogy coupled with industry case-based learning,
   to improve students' critical thinking abilities. For even more
   outstanding results, future studies should examine complex, personalised
   teaching tactics that consider pupils' various learning styles. This
   study highlights the significance of industryrelevant and
   learner-centred teaching approaches, especially in Technical and
   Vocational Education and Training},

Abstract = {This empirical qualitative study investigates whether the introduction
   of heutagogy in contemporary nursing education can foster the
   development of the digital self-determined learner, who is prepared to

   heutagogical design on learner process and outcomes is explored through
   qualitative framework analysis of learner data and reflective educator
   observations. Findings suggest that with careful scaffolding and courage
   in remaining true to the educational philosophy, this approach has the
   potential to develop learners who demonstrate key principles of
   heutagogy including non-linear learning, learner agency, capability,
   self-reflection and metacognition and double-loop learning. This
   innovative study provides insight into the process of developing the
   self-determined learner and encourages further research into flexible

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to construct an entrepreneurship educational
   pattern applicable to all disciplines at the undergraduate level. The
   proposal focusses on two-course models of transdisciplinary
   entrepreneurship education (TEE), which involve andragogy and heutagogy
   as the basis of entrepreneurial competency development.
   Design/methodology/approach The competencies acquired during the
   proposed course models for TEE are analysed through Bayesian methods.
   The study is conducted using 400 opinions of students from Tecnologico
   de Monterrey in Mexico City. Findings The proposed TEE models are
   auspicious for establishing an educational pattern to develop
   entrepreneurship competencies in undergraduate students with the
   independence of their school of origin. Originality/value Nowadays,
   universities recognise the importance of providing entrepreneurship
   education as part of their mission. However, well-defined canons to
   guide such teaching are still non-existent. This paper fills a gap on
   what and how to teach TEE. By providing a new competency classification
   based on soft and technical skills, the authors contribute to the
   pattern of what to teach in entrepreneurship. The authors provide
   guidance on the teaching methods for TEE through two-course models based
   on andragogy and heutagogy. Moreover, their efficacy is measured using
   the students' perception of the acquired competencies and their
   usefulness.},

Abstract = {The development of the digital transformation era has had a major
   influence on the current occupational fields. The challenges faced by
   the next generation of the nation are getting bigger; this is also felt
   by internship teachers (teacher training) who carry out school field
   introduction programs from universities. Seeing the low output to be
   able to get the opportunity to become a teacher with a bachelor's degree
   in education is the main concern of inequitable global civilization. The
   aim of the research is to focus on knowing the needs of internship
   teachers related to digital competence training before they carry out
   the school field introduction program. The research method used is a
   mixed method with a total of 160 active students at Brawijaya University
   who will become internship teachers. The results of the study reveal
   that the need for the aspect of gaining new competencies is 85\%, the
   development of digital competencies is very high, especially in the
   aspect of integrating digital pedagogy, and the knowledge aspect is 65\%
   for increasing heutagogy-based e-training experiences. This study
   concludes that the need for internship teachers for the existence of
   heutagogy-based e-training is very much needed to realize an equitable
   global civilization in the era of digital transformation.},

   education is no longer limited, and this education has given equal
   opportunities to all citizens, especially to the working class.
   Therefore, this study is to identify the elements of need that the
   educational student needs throughout the development of m-learning for
   lifelong education. A total of 11 experts were selected to analyze the
   fuzziness consensus of experts. All of the data obtained will be
   analyzed using the Fuzzy Delphi method. The findings show that
   smartphones are the most appropriate devices in helping students with
   thorough education and the smartphones sit at the first position as
   compared to tablet PC and laptop devices. Whereas, the six heutagogy
   elements that explore, create, connect, share, reflect, and collaborate
   have reached unity with the threshold value of d <= 0.2 and the
   percentage of the expert group is more than 75\%. However, the sharing
   elements have the highest position in the development of modules for
   lifelong education. Therefore, based on the consensus agreements, the
   development of modules for these lifelong educational students should be
   incorporated with the elements of heutagogy according to the position in

Abstract = {Mobile learning is well established in literature and practice, but
   under-evolved from a rigorous learning design perspective. Activity
   theory presents a sophisticated way of mapping and understanding
   learning design, but for mobile learning this does not always translate
   into change in practice. The reported research addresses this by
   coupling a mobile learning specific approach to activity theory with a
   practice-based framework: the design for transfonnative mobile learning
   framework mapped to the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum matrix
   (the DTML -PAH Matrix). Seven case studies are analysed using this
   approach and presented narratively along with framework informed
   analysis. Findings include that the DI'ML -PAH Matrix can be used to
   provide clearer implications and guidance for mobile learning practice,
   and that the DTML -PAH Matrix can also be guided by the practice over
   time. Implications for further research and practice are discussed.},

   scoping literature review to identify effective educational paradigms,
   principles and strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {8},
Abstract = {Transversal Competencies (TCs) (interpersonal, intrapersonal, critical
   thinking and global citizenship skills) are essential skills, knowledge
   and behaviours for work and life success. Limited literature exists on
   methods to develop TC for adult education. This scoping review explores
   how TCs are being embedded into health professional learning and
   strategies to deliver training for the self-directed learner.
   Practitioner Notes
   1. Learners can be taught transversal competencies to self-manage, solve
   problems, relate and collaborate with others.
   2. Teaching methods can be aligned with the learner's objectives through
   selecting appropriate principles and paradigms of education.
   3. Heutagogy was found to be effective for changing attitudes and
   practice in self-directed, independent learners (online).
   4. Adult learners who wish to improve their practice and drive change
   need transformative education rather than compliance teaching.
   5. Educators are encouraged to consider progressing beyond social
   constructivism and humanism paradigms towards transformative learning to
   enable learners to lead change in society.},

Abstract = {The nonlinear learning path used in self-determined learning is more
   adaptable than the linear learning path. However, nonlinear learning
   paths are rarely studied in depth. Indeed, an optimal learning path can
   help students learn more efficiently by reducing cognitive surplus.
   Therefore, the purpose of this study is to generalize a model of
   nonlinear learning path using heutagogy. Based on sixteen primary
   studies spanning two decades of self-determined learning practice, the
   optimal learning path model has been generalized. The findings indicated
   that heutagogy has grown in popularity during the last decade.
   Furthermore, the optimal nonlinear learning path model consists of seven
   steps: (1) As a co-learner, the educator provides the necessary
   introduction; (2) students choose learning tools; (3) students choose
   groupwork activities; (4) students explore and participate in
   student-centered heutagogy activities; (5) the educator observes (and
   assesses) the task; (6) the educator provides learning support; and (7)
   the educator measures the learning outcome. The success of the nonlinear
   learning path is contingent upon the course reconstruction process,
   educator capacity building activities, and assessment of student
   readiness. This study suggests that further research on self-determined
   learning should be conducted to incorporate a nonlinear learning path
   model, particularly in the domain of natural sciences and technology.},

Title = {A Review of the Implementation of Technology-Enhanced Heutagogy in
   Mathematics Teacher Education},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {Low achievement in mathematics across educational levels has long been a
   concern for researchers. Recent evidence points to equipping teachers
   with skills and competencies that align with the demands of the modern,
   technology-rich world. This systematic review explored how
   technology-facilitated heutagogical practices contribute to the
   professional development of preservice and in-service mathematics
   teachers. Drawing on 21 empirical studies published between 2017 and
   2024, this review identified three major findings. First,
   technology-enhanced heutagogical practices promote teaching skills by
   fostering learner autonomy, self-reflection, and professional identity
   development. Second, tools such as mobile apps, Massive Open Online
   Courses (MOOCs), adaptive learning platforms, and collaborative digital
   environments support the integration of heutagogical principles. Third,
   implementation is challenged by limited digital access, institutional
   constraints, and the need for gradual adaptation to self-determined
   learning models. These findings prove the need for policy and
   institutional investment in digital infrastructure, blended learning
   models, and teacher support. Theoretically, this study affirms heutagogy
   as a relevant pedagogical approach for preparing mathematics teachers in
   dynamic learning contexts. There is also a need for more empirical
   studies to investigate scalable models for technology-driven heutagogy,
   especially in resource-constrained settings.},

   Matusov's account, and needed to be integrated with it in order to
   enable the successful implementation of the right to freedom of
   education principle. We will then offer a different typology of the
   field of education, a typology that is complementary, rather than
   contradictory, to Matusov's typology, and use this typology - especially
   the concept of heutagogy - to offer a way that optimizes freedom of will
   in education.},

Title = {Positioning through epistemic cognition in higher education:
   conceptualising the ways in which academics in a business school view

Volume = {87},

Abstract = {Teaching and learning in higher education is informed by a multitude of
   conditioning factors, not least the values systems and outlook of
   academics. Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by
   academics in relation to teaching and learning is therefore important if
   we are to make judgments about how we educate now, and could do so in
   the future. Developments in educational theory and digital technology
   have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in which students learn,
   and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses from
   universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the
   future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has
   attracted interest from those who wish to see greater student control
   over the learning journey- but how widespread is this view amongst
   academics? This paper reports on a qualitative study in which 12
   academics in an English Business School were asked to describe their
   views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate through the
   concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is little
   epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are
   going to innovate, then additional resource and professional development
   should be put in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in
   their epistemological positioning. The paper conceptualises academics'
   positioning through a typology of epistemic views.},

Abstract = {Personalisation plays a vital role in the engagement of adult learners
   in online learning environments. Historically, research has focused on
   applying adaptive technologies, including Artificial Intelligence,
   without integrating those technologies within teaching and learning
   approaches. Academagogy is a teaching and learning approach that allows
   an educator to select appropriate parts from the models pedagogy
   (educator-centred), andragogy (learner-centred), and heutagogy
   (learner-driven) for better learning outcomes. Previous studies used
   academagogy in face-to-face learning contexts; however, academagogy's
   application has been limited in online learning contexts. This paper
   presents our interim observations of applying academagogy to an online
   Information Technology course. Using mixed methods to analyse learner
   self-reflections, online learning analytics, learner grades, learner
   surveys, and learner interviews, we observed that learners progressed
   along the PAH continuum towards andragogy and heutagogy, with some
   exceptions. The exceptions were found where learners regressed on the
   PAH continuum when they encountered problems. The exceptions provide
   insights into the problem areas that block learner engagement and
   achievement, laying a foundation for future work in personalising the
   online learning experience.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of neurodivergent learners attend higher education.
   This necessitates examination of best-fit learning models to
   successfully support the current generation of college students. While
   pedagogy and andragogy have historical relevance, in isolation, they may
   lack alignment with the individualization embedded in
   neurodiversity-affirming practice. This study conceptualized a novel
   learning framework for neurodivergent college students through the lens
   of neurodiversity-affirming practice. Via constant comparative
   qualitative analysis of American university faculty interviews and
   framework juxtaposition, three themes were identified: pedagogy vs.
   andragogy, self-determination, and interdependency. Thematic analysis
   revealed uncertainty regarding best-fit learning framework, with
   consensus reached regarding complexity of serving neurodivergent adults
   in post-secondary settings. An innovative framework titled ``Building a
   Heutagogical Bridge{''} was envisioned, describing the role of
   heutagogy, student-centered, self-determined learning, in connecting
   signature pedagogical and andragogical approaches. This study revealed
   the potentiality of implementing and assessing approaches to skillfully
   incorporate heutagogical, pedagogical, and andragogical principles in
   higher education settings. The perspectives of faculty from the USA
   within this study can inform neurodiversity-affirming practice in
   American universities, while providing implications for future study and
   practice in international college settings, where contexts, needs, and
   culture may differ.},

Abstract = {In the context of contemporary coaching, it is necessary to explore
   approaches that cater to the needs and preferences of modern learners.
   Given the emergence of online/remote coaching and coach development
   (ORC/CD) in recent years, this could involve the exploration of
   frameworks and onto-epistemologies that better ensure alignment with
   contemporary understandings of learning in the digital era. In the
   current article, we take the opportunity to explore some of the possible
   theoretical considerations that can inform future research in this
   emerging area; and thus support the application of technology-enhanced
   coaching/learning in sport coaching contexts. First, we philosophically
   position our arguments within a `new culture of learning' (NCOL) - a
   framework that is congruent with online learning experiences. From
   there, we consider Connectivism - as an expression of New Materialism -
   as a suitable onto-epistemology to guide future research given its
   recognition of networked ways of being in the twenty-first century. We
   conclude by suggesting heutagogy (self-determined learning) as an
   appropriate signature `similar to gogy' for ORC/CD environments.},

Abstract = {Drawing on elements of self-determined learning or heutagogy, the
   graduate employability impact of the UK's leading Universities Business
   Challenge (UBC) competition is investigated over a five year period of
   from 2012-17. A central research question was addressed, namely: what do
   inter-university business simulations, such as the UBC, contribute to
   developing self-determined learner skills and graduate employability? A
   mixed-methods research approach combined structured equation modelling
   (SEM) results of 2 student surveys from over 50 (UK) universities, with
   qualitative analysis of 7 student focus-groups and 15 semi-structured
   interviews. The article contributes to new knowledge about the role of
   UBC as an example of an inter-university business simulation. It models
   the direct and indirect effects of personal/managerial skills
   development and reflective learning capacity (as mediator) on perceived
   employability impact. There is fresh evidence to support the claim that
   reflective learning is important in the study of self-determined
   learning and graduate employability.},

Title = {Creating technology-enabled lifelong learning: A heutagogical approach},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Can a new instructional approach influence lifelong learning and the
   development of competent lifelong learners? Blended and online learning
   provides a platform for learning that introduces technological
   affordance to enable learning. We seek to find an intersection between
   blended and online learning and lifelong learning through an
   instructional approach that encourages learners towards management of
   their own learning. This opens the door to becoming an autonomous,
   capable, self-directed lifelong learner. In this context, heutagogy
   offers an instructional approach that may connect blended and online
   learning settings with the development of lifelong learning competence.
   After conducting a systematic literature review using the terms
   heutagogy, blended and online learning, and lifelong learning,
   literature that considers how to inspire and build human agency
   capabilities over the lifespan was chosen for Delphi method expert
   review. Using this methodology, we explore the possibility that online
   and blended higher education will contribute, where heutagogical
   experiences exist, to technology-enabled lifelong learning. Results
   corroborate the idea that heutagogy and lifelong learning are
   intertwined by some common principles and that these are applicable to
   both blended and online learning settings and lifelong learning.
   Practitioner notes
   What is already known about this topic
   Recent, and what is often continuous, change is impacting all we do,
   including the design and delivery of education.
   This change requires new instructional models that improve immediate
   learning outcomes and prepares learners for learning across the
   lifespan.
   The use of instructional processes labeled heutagogy include the
   opportunity for, and application of, activities of learning
   self-direction, -determination, and -regulation, which can be helpful,
   even essential, for lifelong learning.
   What this paper adds
   This paper identifies an informed perspective, from data, that
   heutagogical design must be consciously implemented and supported for
   online and blended learning by instructional designers, instructors, and
   institutional leadership and infrastructure.
   It is reasonable to suggest that online and blended learning could
   contribute, where heutagogical learning opportunities exist, to
   technology-enabled lifelong learning.
   Instructional practices that include choice, flexible or negotiated
   assessment, facilitation of reflection, learner confidence development,
   and involvement of the learner in designing their learning can be
   considered heutagogical.
   Implications for practice and/or policy
   Develop policy in support of a change in instructional practice that
   embraces a heutagogical approach in the design of courses to foster
   greater self-directed and lifelong learning.
   Educational development to support instructors to understand heutagogy
   and how it can be applied in the design and delivery of blended and
   online learning to foster technology enabled lifelong learning.
   With the implementation of a heutagogical approach, student orientation
   along with purposeful scaffolding needs to be implemented to support
   students as they become more autonomous learners in technology-enabled
   settings.},

Abstract = {As a result, mathematics teachers are prompted to focus on the
   heutagogical approach. However, challenges arise, like inadequate
   training and support among mathematics teachers. Thus, this study
   concentrated on formulating a series of teaching activities aligned with
   the heutagogical approach, specifically tailored to assist mathematics
   teachers in enhancing their teaching methods. This study was conducted
   using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) involving 15 experts with various
   fields of expertise such as mathematics education, educational
   technology, heutagogy, pedagogy and the curriculum as well as primary
   and secondary school mathematics teachers. The data was collected from
   October 2023 to November 2023 by using a questionnaire as the primary
   means of collecting data. Findings were analysed using triangular fuzzy
   number, threshold value, percentage for expert consensus and
   defuzzification process to determine the acceptance and ranking for each
   teaching activity. The results indicate that teachers assign projects
   that require students to explore real-world applications of mathematical
   concepts, were ranked first, followed by other activities, while
   teachers arrange virtual sessions with guest speakers from the
   mathematics field to provide insights to real- world applications were
   ranked last. In conclusion, this study offers valuable insights for
   mathematics teachers interested in enhancing student-centered learning

Title = {Integrating four teaching and learning methods to deliver
   transformational social work education online},
Journal = {SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 1},
Abstract = {As responsive social work education is about meeting the dynamic needs
   of learners, social work educators engage with innovative approaches
   that promote teaching and learning (TAL). The purpose of this article is
   to address the research question: Based on our experience as educators,
   what TAL methods can support social work and human services curriculum
   delivery in an online environment? Using the co-operative research
   method and analyzing our reflections, we proposed a model of curriculum
   delivery which conceptualizes the application of four methods of TAL
   (pedagogy, andragogy, heutagogy, and paragogy). We also illustrate how
   this teaching approach can promote different levels of learning (single,
   double, and triple- loop learning). The model is based on
   internationally agreed principles of social work and can incorporate
   non-Western and Indigenous learning processes. We argue that when
   educators and learners use these four methods in different combinations,
   it is possible to produce learning experiences that augment social work
   skills and knowledge development, as well as prepare learners for a
   multi-dimensional world of change. The implication is that there is
   scope in the presented model to promote transformational learning and
   ways of positive engagement during social disruption and dynamic change,
   both features in our current global environment.},

Title = {Assessing Research Trends in Spiritual Growth: The Case for
   Self-Determined Learning},
Journal = {RELIGIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A review of the contemporary Australian church reveals a spiritual
   malaise in which passive learning has become the main staple for many
   church members or attendees. This sense is heightened by demographic
   trends over the last fifty years that reflect a sustained decline in
   Australians identifying as religious. Although commitment to
   Christianity is seemingly softening, this sociodemographic picture is
   contraindicated by other research that reflects a growing hunger for
   spirituality among many Australians. Given this disparity, there is an
   opportunity to re-examine pertinent understandings of spiritual growth.
   In the literature, notions of spiritual growth are conceptualised by a
   variety of definitions and operationalised by a range of tools and
   practices. Analysis suggests that many models are limited by linearity,
   passivity, and reductionism and do not adequately resonate with the
   complexities inherent in spiritual growth. This literature review
   extends previous research by examining the state of the art in relation
   to spiritual growth. The paper converges around the synthesis that
   heutagogy and coaching are effective twin strategies that may direct
   self-determined learning towards enhanced spiritual growth. This paper
   conceptualises opportunities for future research and thereby lays the
   foundation for an important emergent research agenda. This article
   charts pertinent perspectives and prospects.},

Abstract = {Blended learning is widely known for its ability to improve learning,
   nevertheless little is still known about the best ways of designing
   effective blended learning environment which can support immersive
   learning such as greater learning experience and accessibility to
   education. In this respect, this study investigates the mapping of the
   principles of three Education 4.0 innovative pedagogies, namely,
   heutagogy, peeragogy, and cybergogy, with the capabilities of three
   technological learning tools, that is, Facebook (FB), Learning
   Management System (LMS), and Blog, via a systematic literature review
   technique. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used as the methodology, and the
   literature was further selected using Gough's Weight of Evidence
   criteria, resulting in 59 studies. The results show that cognitive
   factor is the most linked pedagogical principle to the four main
   capabilities of technological learning tools, that is, time,
   self-related, learning task, and learning community-related. This
   mapping is useful for instructors to plan learning and teaching by
   choosing the technological learning tools that match with appropriate
   Education 4.0 pedagogies for optimising the immersive blended learning
   practices.},

Abstract = {The development of survey items includes the preparing and validating
   the items. A construct validity and reliability are two important
   concepts in survey research that are used to assess the quality of
   survey items. This study was conducted to generate on the construct
   validity process of the survey items in heutagogy elements specifically
   for vocational learning. Items have been developed based on relevant
   literature and the context of vocational education in particular leads
   to readiness for employment. Therefore, to go through the process of
   validity and reliability of the items, this study involved 100 students
   from Vocational Colleges to response the survey items. There are 71
   items in a set of questionnaires with six elements consists of
   Exploring, Collaborating, Relationship, Creating, Reflection and
   Sharing. The data was analysed based on Rasch Model as statistical
   measurement model that can be used to assess the validity and
   reliability of research instruments. The construct validity was examined
   by analysing the point-measure correlation index, infit, and outfit
   values; meanwhile, the reliability was examined by analysing the item
   reliability index. The results have shown that the findings of the
   analysis found seven items dropped because the items did not meet the
   requirements of the established analysis. By analysing the data
   collected from the questionnaire, the final instrument shows a total of
   64 items suitable for measuring six elements of heutagogy. The Rasch
   Model differs from other measurement models in reliability assessment by
   focusing on one dimensionality, assessing both person and item
   reliability, enabling item calibration, and providing fit statistics.
   Hence, this systematic approach may facilitate researcher to improve the
   items to produce the good quality of research instrument.},

Abstract = {Pedagogical foundations exist for incorporating technology in
   instruction; however, these foundations have not kept pace with
   technology's evolution. Through the use of Information Communication
   Technologies (ICTs), students now can share content directed at external
   audiences, i.e., audiences other than the instructor. These audiences
   are referred to as authentic audiences as they are public-facing and
   exist outside of the classroom. The existing literature offers evidence
   of student satisfaction with assignments directed at appealing to
   external audiences, however, the literature provides no comprehensive
   pedagogical rationale for assignments directed at authentic audiences
   wherein the goals are self-determined. The authors discuss the theory of
   heutagogy, the study of self-determined learning, as an approach for
   assessing assignments that utilize ICTs and are directed at authentic
   audiences. Finally, the authors offer an approach for the assessment of
   these assignments, including a rubric.},

Abstract = {This paper reports a qualitative study that investigates how five
   different video-based online prototypes impacted in-service music
   teachers' professional knowledge and their learning experiences. Through
   an examination of participants' posts and interviews, the findings
   showed that video-based professional development (PD) could impact
   teacher's pedagogical content knowledge as they afforded reflections
   that could change participants' thinking and provided a vicarious
   experience for music teaching. Situated in a forum, the video-based PD
   sessions allowed for co-construction of knowledge amongst participants.
   The findings also revealed challenges in participants' active and
   sustained participation. The findings are discussed with extant research
   on effective PD and video-based PD, and take cognisance of heutagogy. We
   discuss considerations for online video-based PD in terms of PD content
   design in presenting and exploiting the video material, how we could
   include the diverse and flexible ways of participation, and the role of
   the facilitator in providing a safe environment and encouraging multiple

Title = {Connecting theory and practice: reviewing six learning theories to
   inform online instruction},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {44},
Number = {4-5},
Pages = {321-339},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze six learning theories,
   beyond those presented in an earlier article by the authors, and discuss
   their relevance and application in online instruction.
   Design/methodology/approach The following databases were used to review
   the literature on adult learning theories: Academic Search Premier, ERIC
   and ProQuest. The following key search terms were used in the search
   process: online instruction, cognitivism, connectivism, heutagogy,
   social learning theory, transformative learning theory and Vygotsky's
   zone of proximal development. The titles of the identified articles were
   first reviewed for relevance, followed by the abstract, before any
   further review for suitability for inclusion in this article.
   Findings The theory comparison revealed that it is critical to ascertain
   which learning theory best matches an instructional situation and the
   background of the learners. The selected learning theories differ in
   several parameters. The theories were critiqued for their contributions
   to identified elements in promoting learning. The discussed theories
   suggest ways to improve online learning environments.
   Research limitations/implications Many adult perspectives about
   learning, while called theories, are largely lacking in evidence leading
   to them becoming theories. Thus, there remains a need for empirical
   evidence of these theories and their roles in online instruction.
   Comparisons of the application of these theories for adult learners in
   online instruction would also be useful in establishing the
   effectiveness of the various learning theories in different adult
   learning situations.
   Practical implications This paper provides a theoretical lens for adult
   instructors and instructional designers in incorporating these adult
   learning theories appropriately in improving online instruction.
   Originality/value This literature review uniquely critiques and compares
   common adult theories as they apply to adult online instruction.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Much of the criticism levied against executive education has focussed on
   its lack of real-world relevance. Such is the bifurcation between
   executive education and professional practice that it has been described
   as a `valley of death'. Albeit dramatic in tone, this view of executive
   education points to the need for radical change in the way Business
   Schools conceive and deliver the curriculum. Hitherto, EE has been
   characterised by a pedagogy based on the functional delineation of
   learning to cohorts of students through standardised programmes. In
   recent times, Business Schools have adopted andragogical approaches as
   they look to empower students to exercise greater control over their
   learning-but is this sufficient? Heutagogy offers a view of learning
   that is centred on the self-determination of how individuals learn and
   that is embedded in authentic and life-long learning. This substantive
   review offers a view of future executive education through the
   theorisation of how a heutagogic approach may inform future curriculum
   developments.},

Abstract = {Lifelong learning is an important but often implicit part of the job for

   attitudes towards lifelong learning, motivation for seeking learning
   opportunities, and learning approaches. The Constant Comparative Method
   for Naturalistic Inquiry was used to analyze the transcripts. As
   predicted by heutagogy, the study of self-determined learning,
   participants demonstrated traits of capable learners who view learning
   as part of their job and use a range of approaches to plan and
   continuously reflect on their learning. We recommend that employers
   promote self-determined learning practices within their organization,
   and that educators prepare students to be self-determined learners. We
   further recommend that academia, practitioners, and students contribute
   to repositories of resources and examples to learn from each other.},

   This study aimed to answer the following question: What are the lived
   experiences of middle managers in the banking industry practicing
   heutagogy to develop lifelong learning skills? Data collected from
   individual interviews, focus groups, and journal prompts were
   synthesized using inductive coding to identify patterns and connections
   in the resulting data. Following an in-depth analysis of the collected
   data, five major themes emerged. Learning and employment growth,
   lifelong learning and adaptation, organizational implementation of
   learning, referrals and career advancement, and personal growth through
   experience and accomplishment offer a valuable perspective into middle
   managers' experiences in the banking industry practicing self-directed
   learning. These themes provide insight into the various aspects of their
   personal and professional growth journey. The study concludes by

Title = {A Framework for Mixed Reality Free-Choice, Self-Determined Learning},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN LEARNING TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},
Abstract = {In this article, we present a theoretical framework for mixed reality
   (MR/XR) self-determined learning to enhance ecological literacy in
   free-choice educational settings. The framework emerged from a research
   study in New Zealand which aimed to explore how learning experiences
   which incorporate mobile technologies within free-choice learning
   settings can be designed to enhance learner development of marine
   ecological literacy. An understanding of how mobile technology can be
   integrated into the teaching and learning of sustainability education
   that incorporates free-choice learning contexts, such as visitor
   centres, is of strategic importance to both education outside the
   classroom and adult learning. Following a design-based research
   methodology, the framework is presented in the form of a set of design
   principles and guidelines, informed by key theories in ecological
   literacy and free-choice learning, heutagogy, bring your own device and
   self-determined learning. We briefly describe how the framework provided
   the foundation for an educational intervention. This paper aims to
   assist researchers and developers of MR/XR immersive learning
   environments to consider design principles and processes that can
   enhance learning outcomes within free-choice settings, such as museums
   and visitor centres.},

   departments at FMIPA UNM. The data collection method used was a
   questionnaire. The results of this data collection we present some of
   the questions variables/items included in the dataset. The findings from
   the data show that about 75\% of students of FMIPA UNM agree with the
   use of online learning. In general, the characteristics of students in
   every province in Indonesia are ``similar{''} in terms of thinking
   related to online learning i.e. millennial students, moreover most

Abstract = {This paper explores the experiences of six Academic Skills Tutors (AST)
   responsible for facilitating action learning sets (ALS) on a
   postgraduate module. Our research focused on two elements: first, what
   did the tutors understand by the term critically reflexive practice in
   the context of business and management? Second, what has supported the
   understanding of critically reflexive practice amongst PGT students?
   Specifically, were the module's action learning sets successful in doing
   this?. We distributed an online survey and held focus groups to gather
   qualitative data. We found that the AST's developed their own practices
   and strategies in facilitating action learning sets, beyond the guidance
   they were originally given. Specifically, we argue that the tutors
   improved their ability to facilitate the action-learning sets by
   engaging with the module content and trying it out for themselves in
   their own action-learning set. When we asked the ASTs about their
   overall experiences in facilitating the sets, they described themselves
   as being more critically reflexive as a result of this practice. We
   argue, as we have previously, that in order to guide others on their
   journey to praxis, we must also be engaged in our own learning journeys

Abstract = {The objective of this research was to create a reliable and valid
   measurement tool for measuring self-determined learning skills among
   university students. The research was conducted with the participation
   of 574 university students. In line with expert opinions and
   suggestions, 30-item trial form of the scale was developed. The
   collected data were subjected to Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and a
   structure that explained 42.17\% of the total variance was obtained. It
   has been determined that the Self-Determined Learning Skills Scale
   (SDLSS) consists of 22 items and four dimensions. In addition, as a
   result of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), it was seen that the fit
   indices of the scale were between excellent and acceptable values, and
   the four-factor structure of the scale consisting of 22 items was
   confirmed. The Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficient of the
   scale is.86, and the reliability coefficient calculated by the
   split-half method is.80. To determine the distinctiveness of the items
   in the scale, the corrected item-total correlation was calculated, and
   27\% lower-upper group comparisons were made. Findings from item
   analysis showed that all the scale items were distinctive. As a result,
   it can be said that the ``SDLSS{''} developed is a valid measurement
   tool and will provide reliable scores in determining self-determined
   learning skills.},

Title = {Measuring Learning Presence as Fourth Dimension in the Community of
   Inquiry Survey: Defining Self-Regulation Items and Subscales through a
   Heutagogical Approach},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Community of Inquiry (CoI) has increased in popularity in almost 25
   years due to its adaptability which has spanned from asynchronous
   text-based environments up to a wide range of different settings. The
   CoI identifies the mutual interaction of three dimensions named
   presences. The survey to detect the perception of presences is a
   Likert-scale survey based on 34 items arranged in 10 subscales which are
   assigned as follows: 4 to teaching presence, 3 to social presence, and 3
   to cognitive presence. Several studies identified alternative
   arrangements of the main components as a result of EFA and CFA.
   Consequently, the exploration of alternative settings keeps on revealing
   variations in the way presences interact with each other. The ongoing
   debate about whether to add a fourth dimension, specifically learning
   presence, has produced numerous publications but no definitive revised
   version of the survey. This study suggests an extension of the classical
   survey by incorporating a supplementary set of 12 items related to
   learning presence inspired by the theory of heutagogy (or
   self-determined learning). The sample for the experimental
   four-dimensional CoI framework comprised 55 university students. The
   analysis investigated the internal correlations of this extended survey,
   revealing positive expectations and opportunities for further
   adaptations.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of the paper is to build on current discussions
   about the need for and role of guidance in learning and teaching, as
   well as to theoretically develop its specifics to further advance our
   scholarly understanding of how to structure and enhance entrepreneurship
   education. Design/methodology/approach The paper takes a synthesizing
   conceptual approach, built on developmental psychology, instructional
   science, expertise research as well as the pedagogy-andragogy discussion
   and the role of guidance in contemporary entrepreneurship education
   research. In addition, a new term, odigogy, is developed. Findings
   Odigogy, from the Greek word odigos (to guide), addresses how to
   navigate student entrepreneurs in higher education. The term seeks to
   correspond both to the specifics of entrepreneurship as a subject and
   the characteristics of students in the classroom who are in a
   transitional phase between adolescence and adulthood. Practical
   implications The paper contributes to current entrepreneurship education
   discussions by offering a more balanced terminology positioned between
   how to teach (pedagogy) and how adults learn (andragogy). The paper
   provides insights for teachers when developing teaching methods and
   learning activities in higher education. Originality/value By
   introducing the term odigogy the paper seeks to contribute an enhanced
   understanding of the entrepreneurial learning process in higher
   education, which does not match pedagogical assumptions on how to teach
   children or adolescents, nor andragogical assumptions on how adults
   learn, or how to engage students in self-directed learning as presented
   in heutagogy.},

Abstract = {Opportunities for self-determined online professional development (OPD)
   are emerging, but their potential for increasing adult learners' agency
   is not yet fully realised. Faced with the problem of successfully
   designing a self-determined comprehensive evidence-based online numeracy
   resource for educators who are often time poor and do not engage with
   online learning unless they are intrinsically motivated, we engaged in
   design research to conceptualise the Birth to Level 10 Numeracy Guide
   for educators and families. The Birth to Level 10 Numeracy Guide fosters
   educators' and adult learners' numeracy capability across numeracy focus
   areas from birth to level 10 (16-year-olds). This extensive OPD resource
   incorporates consistent design elements, double-looped learning,
   nonlinear learning, self-reflection, and metacognition activities to
   foster educators' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) through
   experiential learning. With a section dedicated to families, the
   resource provides suggestions and advice to parents and carers on
   everyday, authentic activities to develop children and young people's
   numeracy understandings at home and in the local community. As education
   systems continue to grapple with the disruption brought about by the
   COVID-19 pandemic, the Birth to Level 10 Numeracy Guide is a timely,
   freely accessed, viable, and scalable option for providing low-cost OPD.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper reviews the position of entrepreneurial competency practices
   for sustainability within the learning and development (L\&D) narrative
   over the last three decades. In alignment with the United Nations' 2030
   Agenda for Sustainable Development, gaps within the context of
   entrepreneurial learning theories, learning delivery, and roles of
   interlocutors are addressed. The discourse unfolds the meaning and
   measurement attributes of entrepreneurial competencies, advocating for
   developing an inclusive framework within the entrepreneurial L\&D space.
   Extant literature posits exclusivity in learning theories, learning
   delivery, and role of interlocutors as approaches to achieving
   Entrepreneurial Competencies (EC); however, scarcity in research
   adapting a dynamic and inclusive framework for amalgamating learning
   theories, learning delivery, and roles of interlocutors can impact
   entrepreneurial competency sustainability. This paper analyzes EC to
   achieve L\&D sustainability, employing a mixed-method content analysis
   to develop a dynamic and inclusive framework encompassing learning
   theories, learning delivery, and roles of interlocutors. The paper
   concludes by establishing an Inclusive Framework of Entrepreneurial
   Competency Practices (IFECP) that bridges learning and development gaps,
   namely learning theories, learning delivery, and roles of interlocutors.
   The IFECP is aimed at assisting interlocutors and learners from nascent
   to mastery stages in ECs to embody the core values of the 2030 Agenda
   for Sustainable Development.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Education 4.0 emphasizes the use of hybrid approaches in the learning
   process. The use of peeragogy, heutagogy, and cybergogy may engage
   students in the learning processes in which active learning plays a key
   role. This study aimed to examine the effect of the implementation of
   the Merdeka Curriculum on active learning practices and their
   relationships with hybrid activities based on hybrid learning
   approaches, and active learning counterparts of (1) self-regulated
   learning: (2) self-directed learning, and (3) self-determined learning.
   These relationships will be examined in Indonesian curriculum
   implementation in which student-centered principles are emphasized. A
   cross-sectional survey was conducted by collecting responses of
   vocational high school students on survey. The digital questionnaire was
   sent to 600 Indonesian students, of whom 555 completed it. The
   relationships among the constructs were examined using a structural
   equation modeling. The results showed that a curriculum emphasizing
   student-centered principles was fully mediated by active learning and
   hybrid activities to promote student self-regulated learning (SRL),
   self-determined learning (SDET), and self-directed learning (SDL).
   Active learning and hybrid activities directly affect students' SRL,
   SDET, and SDL, Three counterparts of active learning that form important
   parts of long-life learning. This model indicates that Indonesian
   curriculum implementation may encourage active learning and indirectly
   increase learner engagement, autonomy, and metacognitive development.},

Abstract = {This theoretical article presents the foundational aspects of a
   conceptual, role-playing learning design intended for use in Higher
   Education Schools of computer science and information technology. The
   learning design intends to improve learning ecosystems, bolster student
   engagement and afford learners and educators the benefit of choice and
   amplified autonomy. Second-year students at North-West University (South
   Africa) will be the first cohort to experience the application of the
   newly-designed basic literacy framework which informs the broader
   role-playing learning design exhibited here. The Web literacy framework
   put forward by Mozilla in 2018 to teach critical online proficiencies
   serves as the inspiration for the framework; informing the overall
   role-playing learning design at various levels. Depth of Knowledge
   indicators are mapped onto the Mozilla framework to deepen its
   applicability to tertiary education contexts. Elements of gamification,
   furthermore, are imbedded into the learning design to engage students
   with the self-directed learning aspects of the concept itself, i.e. to
   participate in authentic learning experiences as put forward by
   heutagogical instructional strategies. The role-playing learning design
   makes three roles available to learners, namely: Business Analyst
   (Read), Web Developer (Write) and Customer Service Representative
   (Engage). These roles are tied directly to the three basic literacy
   skill areas iterated upon in the basic literacy framework discussed
   here. Moreover, this article represents part one in a series of articles
   exploring the efficacy and potential of this approach to better serve
   our student cohorts and expand educational offerings. Proceeding papers},

Title = {Editorial: Artifiicial Intelligence is Awesome, but Good Teaching Should
   Always Come First.},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream
   of society some twelve months ago has seriously challenged learning and
   teaching practice. Since then, AI companies such as OpenAI are
   constantly improving their language models and releasing new features to
   make them more capable and useful. So, given there have been many
   disruptors in the past and emerging disruptions in the present, what can
   we learn in this situation, where Generative AI stands poised to
   challenge the purpose and relevance of assessment models? From our
   examples, disruptive technologies only have a major impact when they
   positively transform practice and are informed by pedagogic models and
   learning theory. GenAI as a disruptor is only likely to have this
   positive impact when it informs quality learning and teaching practice.
   We should be focused on the opportunities that GenAI now presents to
   higher education. It is argued here and elsewhere that the relative
   weakness of GenAI is that it creates poor quality output, delivering
   uninformed, incorrect, biased and bland responses. In itself, this
   offers opportunities for `teachable moments' (Newell et al, 2023) and
   gives us room to support students with their capabilities in an AI
   informed world. Historically, these opportunities enable higher
   education to grow and progress. What we have learned so far would
   appears to be that for research to contribute to the literature, they
   needed to be informed by it. Likewise, need to ensure that pedagogy,
   andragogy, and heutagogy come first. We also need to remember that
   people processes happen, artificial intelligence happens around them,
   and that artificial intelligence comes after human intelligence.

Abstract = {Background
   The systemic problems and challenges of general practice within the
   health system require systemic solutions.
   Objective
   Noting the complex adaptive nature of health, illness and disease, and
   its distribution within communities and general practice work, this
   article suggests a model for general practice that allows the full scope
   of practice to be developed while creating seamlessly integrated general
   practice colleges that support general practitioners on their journey to
   `mastery' in their chosen discipline.
   Discussion
   The authors discuss the complex dynamics underpinning knowledge and
   skills development throughout doctors' careers, and the need for policy
   makers to evaluate health improvement and resourcing based on their
   interdependencies with all societal activity. To succeed, the profession
   would have to adopt the principles that form the foundation of
   generalism and complex adaptive organisations to strengthen its ability
   to successfully interact with all its stakeholders.},

Abstract = {In the constantly evolving landscape of 21st-century education,
   innovative pedagogies have emerged as potential tools for enhancing
   learning outcomes and elevating performance in business studies,
   particularly in light of recent legislative changes in South Africa.
   This study investigated the impact of blended learning and incorporating
   these innovative pedagogies, namely, heutagogy, pedagogy, and cybergogy,
   on the performance of business studies learners in the framework of
   contemporary legislation. Despite e-Learning and information and
   communication technology being integrated in South African schools that
   offer business studies, challenges persist in successfully implementing
   blended learning strategies aligned with recent legislation. This
   research centers on the central problem: the obstacles teachers
   encounter when they apply blended learning approaches in the context of
   business studies, considering the implications of recent legislation. by
   using critical social theory as its theoretical framework, the study
   adopted a participatory action learning and action research methodology.
   The research instruments employed include a SWOT analysis and the
   fishbowl approach, which facilitated data generation by co-researchers,
   namely, two preservice teachers, two in-service teachers, one
   information technology specialist, one school principal, two Grade 12
   learners, and two parents. Through critical discourse analysis, the
   findings reveal gaps in the understanding of optimal approaches to
   designing effective blended learning environments that are capable of
   supporting the advancement of business studies in the context of recent
   legislation. Furthermore, the study uncovers that comprehensive guidance
   for creating immersive blended learning environments, which are crucial
   for enhancing and contextualizing learning experiences for the
   21st-century business studies learners, is absent. In conclusion,
   blended learning has brought about transformative shifts in teaching
   methodologies for business studies, which emphasize the importance of
   teachers comprehending the intricacies of learner-centered learning. The
   positive influences of this approach on academic accomplishments,
   learner engagement, and learning outcomes are evident through its
   technology-driven implementations. In particular, learners expressed
   favorable perceptions of blended learning, and saw their increased
   interaction with peers and teachers as a significant advantage.},

Abstract = {Many workplace learning solutions rely on formal online approaches in
   delivery (e.g., video lecture) and assessments (e.g., quizzes). However,
   learning theory has moved toward learner-centred approaches that
   emphasize individual learning concepts, like self-efficacy and
   metacognition, in order to develop a person's ability to learn
   independently. Using an embedded mixed method design, both quantitative
   and qualitative data will be collected to understand self-efficacy and
   engagement in metacognition in a self-determined learning context. A
   quantitative survey will collect information on engagement,
   self-efficacy, and perceived knowledge. A qualitative diary study will
   capture metacognitive strategies and learning reflections which will
   conclude with semi-structured interviews and arts-based elicitation that
   will describe opportunities and barriers in a search-based
   self-determined learning process. This proposed research aims to
   contribute to a personal learner-centred design framework that supports
   positive learning behaviours in an increasingly digital world.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the design of a blended learning intervention to
   enhance the student learning experience, incorporating innovative
   technologies and pedagogies within introductory accounting. The
   design-based research (DBR) methodology involved 68 learners in the
   participatory design of the intervention across three design iterations.
   Emerging from the design process, a framework informed by the key themes
   of Pedagogy, Autonomy, Collaboration, Engagement, Interaction and
   Technology (PACE-IT) was conceptualised, tested and developed. This
   study presents the PACE-IT model which offers guidelines to
   practitioners who seek to design blended learning to provide students
   with a rich and meaningful learning experience. The emergence of
   COVID-19 underscores the relevance of these findings. PACE-IT provides
   direction to accounting educators working within an unfamiliar
   educational context, today and in the future, where there is an
   imperative to develop new approaches to accounting education that
   combine face-to-face with online interaction and learning.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the initial development of a
   learner -centered teaching (LCT) in the ``Sports Coach{''} course, from
   the Sports Science program at University of Campinas. Following a
   qualitative approach and action research procedures, we present the

   through the program and institutional plan, class plans and logbook; the
   teachers' perspective through critical-reflective conversations and
   logbook entries; the opinions of the student-coaches through
   questionnaires and focus group. We used the thematic analysis technique.
   The LCT showed to be complex, especially due to the appropriation of
   principles and development as an approach. The student-coaches perceived
   an approximation of the course to the practical reality of the coach,
   contributing to motivation and significant learning. We emphasize the
   need to train teachers in LCT and to take the role of coach developers

   situational analysis, intervention and follow-up phase. Data was
   collected across the phases using semi-structured interviews, two
   questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions and participant
   journaling. Notwithstanding discipline, the findings reveal ubiquitous
   access to mobile technologies among the student-teachers as well as
   positive attitude towards academic usage of devices. Subject-based
   disparities, however, became apparent during the situational analysis in
   relation to actual usage although they were levelled during the
   intervention. Additionally, the occurrence of heutagogical practices
   increased significantly over the intervention period.},

Abstract = {Open education resource (OER) has become an increasingly important topic
   for consideration in the open distance learning (ODL) context. ODL
   students' education should be learner-centered based on intrinsic

   student teachers' experiences in using open education resource in ODL.
   Even though many studies have been conducted on OER in ODL, there are
   insufficient empirical studies that have explored environmental
   education (EE) student teachers' experiences in using OER in the ODL
   environment. In exploring this topic, the qualitative research
   methodology, interpretive paradigm, and rhizomatic approach were used.
   Participants and documents were purposefully sampled. Data was ethically
   collected through documentation and semi-structured telephonic
   interviews. The data were thematically analysed and processed to find
   patterns, keywords were identified, coded, and clustered into
   categories, and themes emerged. Qualitative findings showed that EE
   student -teachers knew about OER informally and some students wanted to
   use OER. Hindrances to OER usage by student-teachers included little
   engagement with OER by lecturers and costs to access OER.},

Title = {AFFORDANCES IN EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY: PERCEPTIONS OF TEACHERS AND
   STUDENTS IN OMAN},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {931-952},
Abstract = {Aim/Purpose This study of affordances in educational technology focuses
   on how the selfperceptions of teachers influence the creation of
   educational opportunities and how these are received by learners.
   Background It is important to explore the affordances offered by
   teachers, when using educational technology, from the perspective of
   their students. Within this topic, the interface of the educational
   technology affordances with the two agents-teachers and students-has
   often been neglected. Hence, the learning possibilities in educational
   interactions for the learners cannot be separated from the interactional
   possibilities created by teachers. The extent to which teachers can
   create opportunities to address their students' needs, while effectively
   conveying the value of these opportunities to their students, is likely
   to impact on how well these affordances for learning and collaboration
   are utilised.
   Methodology A survey that includes two questionnaires was used. The
   questionnaires were circulated to 102 teachers and their 354 adult
   students in six higher education institutions in Oman. The
   questionnaires were analysed by SPSS Amos v20 for statistical measures
   such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation.
   Contribution The study contributes to the field of e-learning because it
   demonstrates that the affordances offered by teachers for e-learning
   have an impact on the possibilities for students to engage. Both
   affordances were found to be highly correlated statistically. Further,
   teachers were found to primarily use the lowest level of engagement for
   online tasks, requiring low levels of cognitive challenge and social
   involvement from the learner.
   Findings The results indicate a low to medium level of self-directed
   learning that significantly correlates with perceptions of teaching
   possibilities for learning interactions.
   Recommendations for Practitioners Teachers are encouraged to vary
   approaches to student engagement in online teaching materials such as
   enhancement, additional engagement opportunities, and extension so that
   students are encouraged to use different cognitive abilities and
   capabilities to engage in social interactions.
   Impact on Society
   This study presents a strong recommendation with regards to extending
   the online affordances towards social interactions of learning beyond
   the boundary of the classroom.
   Future Research Further studies on e-heutagogy and affordances of both
   teachers and students are needed. The effect of teachers created
   opportunities on students learning actions is an area that grants
   further investigation.},

Abstract = {COVID19 outbreak brought about many challenges including the shifting of
   university assessments to conduct in online mode. This research study
   tries to explore the impact of newly designed online formative
   assessments on students' learning, in a Plant Physiology course. The
   designing of assessments were carried out focusing on constructive
   alignment, for which an Open Book Test (OBT) was conducted in three
   parts: OBT1 -problem based learning assignment, providing feedback using
   a rubric; OBT2 -multiple choice, multi response, matching and missing
   word questions with immediate feedback; OBT3 -analysing research results
   with MCQs and short answer questions with feedback. A mixed approach of
   convergent parallel design method was followed to collect data through
   two questionnaires and interviews. Findings indicated students'
   engagement in self- determined learning in solving a real-world problem
   and their enthusiasm in learning with research-based questions in
   assessments, while self-assessing their performance through feedback.
   However, geographically varied technological challenges need to be
   addressed in conducting successful online assessments.},

Abstract = {Mixed reality (XR) environments combining real-to-virtual immersive
   experiences provide unprecedented potential for reframing educational
   pedagogy and practice. XR environments provide scaffolded learning
   points accommodating individual needs, while enhancing sensorial and
   embodied experiences. XR environments can facilitate self-determined
   (heutagogical) experience-based learning and esthetic visualization of
   wicked problems, making complex knowledge more accessible. Here we
   report on a study exploring the design of mobile learning with education
   outside the classroom (EOTC), heutagogy, and free-choice learning to
   enhance marine ecological literacy, based on a bring your own device
   (BYOD) XR intervention at a marine educational center in Aotearoa New
   Zealand. Findings indicate that XR affordances can enhance the
   understanding of complex marine conservation science, facilitating
   ecological literacy knowledge, attitudes and behavior change.
   Implications include pedagogical rethinking of EOTC with self-determined
   mobile learning; haptic, sensorial and embodied XR design considerations
   for environmental education; and epistemological speculation on learning

Abstract = {The Covid 19 pandemic requires critical re-evaluation of the way Higher
   Education can help students maximise their learning to adjust and adapt
   to a new reality. This requires a holistic approach which extends beyond
   consideration of student learning in formal settings to understanding
   the role informal learning can play. Whilst research exists on informal
   independent learning, less focus has been placed on how students
   collaborate informally as part of their learning process. In this study
   interviews with HE students in Spain and the UK offer insight into
   variable but beneficial informal collaborative learning (ICL) practices.
   The value attributed to ICL emphasises its potential contribution to the
   current educational landscape and the merit of recognising it as a
   distinct concept. Further, uneven access and the role of learner
   maturity signal the potential for universities to enhance learning and
   increase access by playing an active a role in developing ICL skills and
   personal networks.},

   addressing the management of its limitations and ethical considerations.
   Furthermore, we explore the use of ChatGPT as a medical instructor in a
   medical classroom context. We seek to elucidate responses to a preset of
   questions in two categories separated based on targeted remediation,
   pedagogical knowledge, teacher ethics, query detail, practicality, and
   communication pattern. These responses are analyzed based on two rubrics
   designed on the basics of pedagogical prerequisites, and findings are
   reached with a thorough comparative analysis. We hope that this research
   will improve the effective implementation of ChatGPT as a tool for
   enhancing learning and skill development while maintaining ethical
   awareness for medical professionals.},

Abstract = {In higher education, heutagogical design principles may be utilized to
   foster active teaching and learning to engage learners in an online
   learning environment. This research study aims to investigate the
   application of heutagogical design principles such as exploration,
   creation, collaboration, connection, reflection, and knowledge sharing.
   Therefore, a scoping review was conducted to identify and analyze the
   potential use of heutagogical design principles across a variety of
   online instructional approaches, including personalized learning, peer
   learning, smart learning, self-regulated learning, independent learning,
   learner-centered learning, facilitative learning, collaborative
   learning, free-choice learning, and lifelong learning within the
   theoretical framework of heutagogy. The results revealed that the most
   frequent instructional approaches included collaboration,
   self-regulation, personalization, and lifelong learning. Thus,
   instructional approaches encouraged students to connect with peers and
   instructors within the facilitative learning environment. As a result,
   instructors developed students' 21st century skills in the scope of
   engaging, meaningful, and experiential learning environments. Online
   teaching and learning in higher education might be diversified based on
   heutagogical principles and instructional approaches and their
   subsequent implementation in the context of higher education.},

   Wenger and Wenger-Trayner's communities of practice evaluation
   framework, which outlines seven levels of value, to explore the
   potential outcomes and benefits of ICWGs-Public, based on a series of
   semi-structured interviews with participants. ICWGs-Public show
   potential as a model for cross-institutional community-based academic
   development, particularly if the community of practice has a strong

   integrate student voice in higher education},
Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 8},
Abstract = {Class participation is integral to student learning as it promotes
   engagement and the expression of student voices. However, attempting to
   `get students to talk' without acknowledging their diverse identities
   and needs can inadvertently reinforce oppression. Grounded in a
   heutagogical framework, this action research was conducted to address
   this limitation and advocate for diverse participation formats, such as
   inviting students to share relevant news, introduce innovative learning
   materials, or create social media content related to the subject field
   for broader audiences. Surveys with quantitative and qualitative
   measures, along with instructor journaling, were used to assess
   students' perceived empowerment and to identify specific highlights and
   challenges from both students' and the instructor's perspectives. The
   results indicate that students find authentic ways to voice themselves
   through contributing to collective learning in formats aligning with
   their skills and comfort and perceive a stronger sense of empowerment
   afterwards. The findings contribute to the discourse on student voice
   implementation by highlighting the significance of varied participation
   formats in empowering students to develop adaptive leadership and boost
   engagement and agency in higher education.},

   how coaches do this has yet to receive much attention. This
   investigation draws on a thematic analysis of 10 semistructured
   interviews that followed coaching sessions with an explicit focus on
   developing independence. Three themes emerged: developing a cognitive
   performer, an attuned coaching process that fosters independence, and
   developing the individual's capacity to learn. The findings suggest that
   learners have an explicit comprehension of the ``what and why{''} of the
   performance and coaches develop the learner's ability to learn both how
   and where to continue their development postcoaching. The coaches
   achieve these two objectives by developing a long-term independent
   performance in their coaching practice. Coaches are not trying to
   develop fully independent performances during coaching, but instead to
   prepare learners to continue their development with adaptable
   performances within the practicalities of learning in adventurous
   environments.},

Abstract = {Early childhood educators' professional knowledge and skills are often
   underappreciated (Moloney, 2015; Moss, 2006) even though they
   significantly impact children's outcomes (Ackerman, 2004; Bellm and
   Whitebrook, 2004; Sylva, et al., 2004). In Malaysia, many early
   childhood educators lack qualifications and the resources to pursue them
   (Foong, et al., 2018). This study explored the experiences of seven
   early childhood educators in Malaysia with web-based informal
   professional development through interviews and media go-alongs,
   examining participants' use of and perception towards Web 2.0,
   particularly for self-directed and interactive learning.Results showed a
   burgeoning integration of Web 2.0 platforms in participants'
   professional learning. Participants emphasised the significant role of
   personal attitudes and workplace culture in encouraging learning and
   technology adoption and expressed interest in the development of Web 2.0
   communities of practice that support professional discourse and
   knowledge creation. These have the potential to strengthen professional
   identities and foster society-wide recognition of early childhood
   education as a profession.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 global pandemic radically disrupted face-to-face teaching
   of practice-skills within social work programs in many countries. Across
   the globe, campuses closed suddenly, meaning students and staff had to
   quickly transition to online platforms to sustain teaching and learning
   interactions. In response to this unprecedented and demanding situation
   and from the perception of the inquirers, this article documents the
   critical pedagogical and heutagogical factors associated with teaching
   practice-skills online, during the current challenging and destabilising
   epoch. Co-operative Inquiry is used to critically reflect on the `hard'
   technological applications and engagements experienced by social work
   academics, and learning and teaching technologists from a university,
   who urgently developed and delivered intensives online during this
   complex time. The thematic analysis identifies four pedagogical and
   heutagogical factors vital for educating during such a time. These are:
   responsiveness, collective leadership, dynamic interaction between staff
   and students, and critical reflection. The implication being, that these
   factors can become solid foundations for transformational online
   learning in dynamic teaching environments. The article provides a timely
   empirically-based examination of the delivery of skill-based intensives
   online during a challenging and destabilising period, the associated
   teaching processes, and the technological affordances.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, we consider some of the key ideas that impact on the
   creation of online learning environments. By exploring some aspects of
   theory, namely connectivism and its relation to wider ideas of
   community-building, heutagogy, and motivation, we articulate some of the
   factors that have influenced the authors' practice in creating online
   learning. We illustrate these influences by outlining examples of three
   courses which we have been party to creating, so that interlinked theory
   and practice are in evidence. By looking at a teacher education program,
   a childhood practice program, and a short access course, we provide
   examples of some of the ways in which we have scaffolded the development
   of learning communities, encouraged students to have autonomy over the
   direction of their learning, and engaged students to maintain their
   motivation for learning. At times, these three dimensions are
   interpenetrating, and in two of our case studies, longevity and ongoing
   improvements have enabled the authors to have confidence in the quality
   and value of these courses, while the third focuses on a newly created
   course.},

Abstract = {Perceiving learning with/in/as/for community enriches socio-ecological
   learning and encourages powerful interactions between human and
   non-human nature. The value and significance of community and
   collaboration is widely acknowledged, both within and beyond formal
   education, however perceptions of community have traditionally been
   human-centric. Furthermore, research and practice frequently indicates
   that community connections require greater consideration and effort in
   order to be effectively realised. In response, this chapter positions
   community as an authentic and essential foundation for socioecological
   learning, situating learning within the interconnected elements of
   social and ecological worlds. The authors grapple with the concept of
   community and situate community with/in/as/for socioecological learning.
   Their four diverse examples of community connection are shared through
   research stories, thereby expanding perceptions of community beyond
   teachers and students using their local social and ecological community
   as a resource for learning. This exploration illuminates the potential
   of community to enrich socioecological learning experiences. In essence,
   this chapter is a storied exploration of community with, from and about
   places, spaces, students, parents, teachers, researchers, community
   members and non-human nature.},

   Based on theories and practices},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the all-around
   development and mental health of students in education. Positive
   education, a rapidly developing ramification of positive psychology, has
   proved beneficial to students' learning and wellbeing. Meanwhile, online
   learning has quickly gained popularity due to the impact of COVID-19.
   However, there have been few reports discussing the relationship between
   positive education and online learning by combining theories and
   practices. To explore the connection between positive education and
   online learning, we provide a literature review for studies, mostly
   between 2010 and 2022, of theories and practices for both positive
   education and online learning. Next, we establish one-to-one links
   between the relevant theories and practices of online learning to each
   domain in the PERMA model of positive education, a theoretical framework
   including Positive emotion(P), Engagement(E), Relationship(R),
   Meaning(M), and Accomplishment(A). We aim to explore how to promote the
   development of positive education by applying the theoretical and
   practical advantages of online learning to the PERMA framework of
   positive education. This study aims to enrich the research perspectives
   of positive education and provide a reference for future research.},

Abstract = {Around 25 years ago, some researchers argued for moving towards
   innovative learning models characterised by being more personalised and
   where the students would have a more active role in deciding what to
   learn, when to learn and how to learn. Nowadays, there is a need for a
   flexible, efficient, universal and lifelong education. Lifelong learning
   is fully integrated into our society and, from the student point of
   view, it is very different from regular learning. Among these
   differences there is the maturity of students, the fact that the domains
   of interest are much broader, the way how learning occurs at different
   depths, the fact that the topics to study may be related to work, family
   and leisure, and that students have little availability due to their
   necessity to conciliate home, work, leisure and learning. Lifelong
   learning requires personalised models that adapt to students' needs and
   constraints, but lifelong learners keep suffering from models that are
   adapted neither to their necessities, nor to the needs of society. This
   paper reflects on the actual situation of lifelong learning, analyses
   some of the relevant literature and discusses the challenges to
   conceptualise, from a transdisciplinary point of view, innovative
   e-learning models that promote self-determination of students.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION \& KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Number = {06},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Neo-learning was developed as a teaching and learning methodological
   platform for the networked university (NU) model in order to promote
   experiential and expansive learning for competence development and
   facilitate the transfer of learning into work practice. The objective of
   this paper is to analyse the neo-learning methodology as a
   methodological support for the NU model. To achieve this objective, a
   qualitative approach was chosen for exploratory and descriptive purposes
   through a narrative literature review and multiple case studies. This
   paper presents the main approaches and theories that underlie the
   network university (NU) and the neo-learning methodology. It also
   presents the guidelines of the NU, the neo-learning cycle, the
   mechanisms that facilitate the application of neo-learning in the NU,
   and the analysis of these mechanisms in three case studies. In
   conclusion, it is confirmed that the neo-learning methodology is aligned
   with the NU model and attends to the objective of subsidising the
   teaching and learning processes. Neo-learning has been validated in
   empirical research studies, both in academic and corporate universities
   (CUs), as well as in undergraduate courses, graduate programs and online
   courses, in presential or remote learning modalities.},

Title = {Cultivating Awareness: A Framework for Online Learning in Open Distance
   Learning},
Journal = {OPEN PRAXIS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-69},
Abstract = {Distance education institutions worldwide are adopting online learning
   to take advantage of its benefits. However, online learning is often
   seen as a mode of delivery that will work for any distance education
   institution in any context. The increased relevance of online learning
   during and after the COVID-19 pandemic has further exaggerated the
   adoption of online learning, which requires ongoing research on the
   actual use of online learning, and this study responds to this need.
   Therefore, this study aimed to determine how online learning is used in
   an open distance learning (ODL) context. A case study on the
   implementation of online learning was conducted at an ODL university in
   South Africa. Data were collected through open-ended questionnaires,
   interviews, and non-participant online observation. Participants were
   purposefully selected academics from various colleges in the university.
   Findings reveal that awareness of educational choices in the online
   environment appeared to be neglected. Based on the findings, the study
   presents a framework for online learning in ODL. It is built on the
   concept of awareness, and we argue that the integration of online
   learning should be carefully curated and planned with intentional
   institutional, lecturer, and student awareness. The principles of the
   theories of transactional distance, the community of inquiry, social
   constructivism and heutagogy should guide the operationalisation of each
   type of awareness presented in the framework.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The pressing need to address the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in
   business education demands a shift from traditional teaching methods
   toward design-inspired pedagogical models. This paper introduces a
   specific pedagogical innovation, that is, a Design for Iteration (DFI)
   strategy embedded within a studio-based learning environment, developed
   through a cross-institutional partnership to educate future business
   leaders. The studio model emphasizes experiential, visual, and iterative
   learning processes such as the `crit', prototyping, and peer-led
   feedback. Anchored in a heutagogical (self-determined) approach, this
   innovation moves beyond isolated creative exercises toward sustained
   engagement with complex, real-world sustainability challenges. Drawing
   on qualitative data from the implementation of the EULab Nantes studio,
   the paper explores how iterative, practice-based learning develops
   critical skills in adaptive thinking, problem-framing, collaboration,
   and system-level inquiry. The findings underscore the role of
   socio-materiality and peer-led sense-making in shaping meaningful
   learning and identifies the studio as a space for cultivating the
   mindsets and capabilities central to responsible management and
   sustainability education. By foregrounding the studio as a site for
   prototyping sustainable market futures, the paper contributes to
   reimagining business schools as platforms for transformative
   sustainability learning.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {154-173},
Abstract = {ChatGPT is taking the world and the education sector by storm. Many
   educators are still hesitant to integrate it within their curricula,
   owing to the limited practical and theoretical guidance on its
   applications, despite early conceptual studies advocating for its
   potential benefits. This pedagogical innovation applied an effectual
   logic to implement ChatGPT for a founding team activity within an
   entrepreneurship course. Composing a founding team is an inundating task
   in venture creation, with long-lasting consequences. So far, there is
   yet to be an ideal approach proposed in literature or observed in
   real-life for doing it. In this pedagogical innovation, three student
   teams with varying business ideas prompted ChatGPT using different
   keywords and levels of details, to get recommendations on essential team
   members, their roles and equity split. Each team presented their
   findings, and then the classroom engaged in a collective discussion. The
   students were surveyed afterwards to assess the reception and
   effectiveness of the intervention. Their feedback showed an overwhelming
   favoritism of ChatGPT, as a convenient and resourceful learning tool.
   The study establishes the potential value of ChatGPT as a heutagogical
   tool that supports student-centric entrepreneurial learning across
   educational institutions and the entrepreneurship ecosystem that extends
   to the venture creation process.},

Abstract = {Objectives: This scoping review aims to identify effective strategies
   that foster autonomous learning (AL) in prelicensure nursing courses and
   examine the associated domains across interrelated factors that
   positively influence learner autonomy (LA) development in nursing
   education. Design: A PRISMA-guided scoping review used four databases:
   Academic Search Premier, CINAHL Complete, ERIC, and MEDLINE. Eligible
   studies published between April 2013 and April 2023 were selected.
   Review methods: The review protocol followed the updated methodology
   guideline by Peters et al. (2020) to conduct rigorous member checking,
   and the PRISMA-scoping review checklist was used as a writing guide to
   generate an overview of the investigated topic. Result: Seven studies
   reviewed. Various teaching strategies promote AL, such as flipped
   classrooms, problembased learning, and small group learning in virtual
   and augmented realities. Eight domains across 19 factors were
   distinguished in promoting AL. Enhanced self-motivation is most crucial
   in developing LA. Conclusion: This review emphasizes the connection
   between effective teaching methods, autonomy-supportive settings, and
   students' perceptions of AL in nursing education. It offers new insights
   for nurse educators to promote LA. (c) 2023 Organization for Associate

Abstract = {The research explores the perceptions of five secondary school students
   with special education needs (SEN) about their participation in
   learning, group membership, and agency within an inclusive school in
   Macau SAR. This goal is achieved by using students' voices documented in
   open-ended interviews and is underpinned by the conceptual framework of
   heutagogy. The aim is to shed light on students' perceptions on school
   effectiveness in supporting their needs through successful participation
   and agentic possibilities. Findings showed that students were more prone
   to social rejection and being isolated or bullied than their peers. They
   were struggling to feel included or participate, their needs were only
   partially being met, and they had few opportunities to exert influence
   on their educational trajectories. Recommendations are provided to
   assist educators and schools in enhancing students with SEN to connect
   to the learning process and community, with the provision of appropriate
   learning adjustments and more active approaches to ensure their
   acceptance by mainstream students, including the formation of coaching
   peers to assist in developing social and academic skills under teacher's
   scaffolding practices. This study highlights the contribution of the
   heutagogical perspective to advance research on the participation and
   agency of students with SEN in mainstream schools.},

Title = {Learning Digital Humanities in a Community of Practice: the DEAR model
   of Postgraduate Research Training},
Journal = {DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {To date, there has been relatively little discussion of how the UK
   doctoral funding landscape shapes digital humanities pedagogy for
   postgraduate research students. This article sets out to address this
   relative lack, by introducing the inter- and multi-disciplinary context
   in which many students in the UK work. We examine the phenomenon of
   students who are not necessarily interested in becoming DH
   practitioners, but have identified DH as a knowledge gap in their own
   disciplinary practice. Such a realisation changes the nature of the
   learner within DH communities of practice, requiring a different form of
   learning.
   This study therefore explores learning within a community of practice,
   the inter- and multi-disciplinary space in which digital humanities
   practitioners operate. First, drawing on the diverse disciplinary
   landscape, it highlights an individual's learning journey through
   self-determined learning (heutagogy). Second, it outlines an idea of
   digital humanities pedagogy for postgraduate research based on current
   frameworks of digital literacies and broader researcher development in
   the UK, framing research activity as learning. Third, it presents the
   DEAR model for learning and teaching design, which is based on four
   principles: Diversity; Employability; Application; and Reflection.
   Finally, it provides an evaluation of the DEAR model in the context of
   one UK Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP). It contributes to
   understanding of pedagogical practices for doctoral-level DH training
   and provides a set of recommendations for instructors to adopt and adapt
   these pedagogical principles in their own programmes.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the philosophical concept of epistemic injustice and
   contends its significance and relevance to mental health nurse education
   and clinical practice. The term epistemic injustice may be unfamiliar to
   mental health nurses, yet the effects are readily visible in the
   dismissing, silencing, and doubting of service users' knowledge,
   testimony, and interpretation. Existing professional values and clinical
   standards lack depth and critical exploration pertaining to epistemology
   and associated ethical concerns. Despite central tenets of
   person-centred care and valuing the service users' voice, epistemic
   injustice continues to occur. Epistemic injustice cannot be summed up
   merely by asking nurses to listen to service users. This represents an
   oversimplification of epistemology, ignoring the complexities of social
   influence and knowledge exchanges. Epistemic injustice brings something
   new and innovative to the nursing curriculum and fits within the
   principles of heutagogy. It encourages deep reflexivity surrounding the
   ethical issues of power inequalities and intersectionality. Inclusion in
   mental health nursing education allows for the social and political
   powers of psychiatric diagnosis as a form of silencing and stigma to be
   examined. Practical application is made to mental health nursing
   education and practice with epistemological values and ethical reflexive
   prompts. These can be utilised by educators and lecturers for
   pre-registration mental health nurse education, post-registration, and
   continued professional development.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on a study set in Wales where the Further Mathematics
   Support Programme Wales supports the provision of an advanced
   qualification in mathematics for 16- to 18-year-old students with
   courses delivered in reduced teaching time. The study aimed to
   understand how the students experienced the Further Mathematics (FM)
   courses which are delivered either face-to-face or online and, more
   generally, to negotiate a place of alternative forms of delivery in
   post-16 mathematics curriculum. Sixteen students, eight of whom studied
   through the online course, were interviewed; overall, although they
   found the course challenging both in terms of the content and relatively
   limited teaching time, they enjoyed it and appeared to perceive benefits
   from taking the course. Most volunteered `tips' about coping with the
   challenges of the course and the tips can be seen as strategies of
   self-regulation. Self-regulation strategies were reported more strongly
   by the students taking the course online than those attending
   face-to-face classes. In view of the evidence of technology creating new
   learning environments perceived as advantageous by students, it is
   hypothesized that introducing blended learning as part of post-16
   mathematics curriculum could be beneficial. Improving learner
   self-regulation is discussed as means of improving access to FM. Other
   findings included the importance of support from peers, parents and
   schools and gender differences.},

Abstract = {In the post-pandemic era, lifelong learning (LLL) emerged as the key to
   professional development and the core competency of all disciplines.
   Even globally, there is a dearth of evidence based bibliometric
   analysis, notably on LLL. This study addresses this gap by examining the
   data retrieved from the Elsevier Scopus database. A systematic search
   method was adopted to retrieve 1806 publications from 790 journals from
   1963 to 2022. The R package, Biblioshiny, was used for data analysis,
   including productivity/performance analysis, citation analysis, and
   collaboration network analysis of social structure. The findings showed
   that the number of publications has significantly increased over time. A
   large number of studies were published in 2022. Overall, 85 countries
   contributed to LLL. Among them, the United States was the most
   productive with 787 publications, and the United Kingdom was the country
   with 4731 citations. Learning was the trending topic, and skill
   development was an emerging theme in LLL. The results will aid the
   stakeholders in identifying largely unexplored areas of research that
   need more attention and funding. This study outlines not only the
   current scientific developments but also the potential future of LLL
   research. This study will also be used as a resource for researchers and
   teachers in LLL. Future research directions in this area of knowledge
   are also outlined.},

Abstract = {Given the rise of social media engagement within society, there are
   challenges for tutors in blended and online contexts to provide
   opportunities for social constructivist learning experiences within
   their institutional learning environments. This article proposes a
   module approach to teaching, learning and assessment for learners
   undertaking part-time, vocationally related degrees. A mixed methods
   approach was adopted to conduct a detailed exploration of eight tutors'
   practice with data gathered from three principal sources. Interviews
   with tutors explored their approaches to delivery and considered factors
   that impacted on quality; students' perceptions of their learning
   experiences were assessed using an attitude survey; and an analysis of
   the content and communications in the virtual learning environment
   provided insight into tutors' online practice. Analysis of modules
   suggested limited online peer-to-peer interaction, with tutors noting
   the difficulties of promoting engagement. The article argues for a
   constructivist approach in this context with a need for tutors to
   promote a simple module structure, focused around assessment, that
   creates space for learning. This structure appeared appropriate for
   these learners, enabling them to manage the influence of daily events,
   together with pressures and time constraints of work. The findings could
   aid tutors in designing and delivering courses for similar groups of
   learners.},

Abstract = {Field education globally, has been highly disrupted by restrictions
   associated with COVID-19. This disruption has forced many students to
   engage with online learning. The current article presents a student-led
   co-operative inquiry exploring the experience of four social work
   students undertaking a remote research-based placement in regional
   Australia during a global pandemic. In this inquiry students' critically
   self-reflected on the strengths and challenges of remote research-based
   placements. Despite some initial reservations, the students' experience
   was positive overall. This article reports on four key themes that
   emerged from this inquiry: the translation of social work communication
   and relationship-building skills to online environments, the development
   of professional identity in a remote research-based placement, access to
   supervision in a remote context, and reflection on the experience of
   completing a research placement guided by the social work value of
   respect for persons. We conclude that undertaking a remote research
   placement helped forge students' appreciation for the role of research
   in social work, enhanced their communication and research skills, and
   strengthened students' sense of professional identity. These findings
   confirm remote research-based placements can offer relevant and
   effective placement opportunities that can inform social work
   field-education heutagogy as we move beyond the restrictions associated
   with the pandemic.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the level of readiness for massive open online
   courses (MOOCs) of students in Oman. It compares the readiness of
   ordinary students in the Omani higher education institutions (HEIs) and
   those outside HEIs who took a MOOC from the larger Omani society and
   tests for the differences between their levels of readiness.
   Additionally, it tests for the best predictor for future participation
   in MOOCs. In this study, readiness is defined as the possession of three
   sets of skills: technological, metacognitive, and motivational. A
   sequential two-phase research approach was used by first collecting data
   from 428 students in different HEIs and then collecting the same data
   from 253 non-HEI students from the general public who were offered and
   took a MOOC specifically designed for this study. While high levels of
   the three sets of skills were found in both study samples, the MOOC
   students were found to have significantly higher motivational and
   metacognitive skills than the higher education students. In this study,
   binary regression results indicate that comfort with eLearning is the
   best predictor for future participation in MOOCs. Given the high student
   readiness for MOOCs in Oman in this study, some recommendations are
   provided for higher education institutions to benefit from the
   fast-moving MOOC phenomenon.},

Abstract = {There are known issues in authentic assessment design practices in
   digital education, which include the lack of freedom-of-choice, lack of
   focus on the multimodal nature of the digital process, and shortage of
   effective feedbacks. This study looks to identify an assessment design
   construct that overcomes these issues. Specifically, this study
   introduces an authentic assessment that combines gamification (G) with
   heutagogy (H) and multimodality (M) of assessments, building upon rich
   pool of multimodal data and learning analytics (A), known as GHMA. This
   is a skills oriented assessment approach, where learners determine their
   own goals and create individualized multimodal artefacts, receive
   cognitive challenge through cognitively complex tasks structured in
   gamified non-linear learning paths, while reflecting on personal growth
   through personalized feedback derived from learning analytics. This
   pilot research looks to: (i) establish validity of all elements within
   the assessment design, and (ii) identify if application of assessment
   design leads to improved learner satisfaction. Results showed positive
   validations of all key elements of the GHMA assessment model, as
   beneficial factors tied to positive learner satisfaction on assessment
   delivery. There existed statistically significant post-and pre-treatment
   differences between experimental and control group satisfaction levels,
   indicating positive receptivity of GHMA authentic assessment design in
   digital education.},

Title = {Digital Environments of Education 4.0 and complex thinking:
   Communicative Literacy to close the digital gender gap},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The gender digital divide (GDD) is a social phenomenon that denies
   citizens access to technologies, the internet, and the services
   associated with Education 4.0. Reducing this gap requires communicative
   literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to
   create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual
   environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that
   focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological
   world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical
   principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which
   emphasize the use of technology, self -determined learning, and
   collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the
   participation of 124 Mexican students of technical -professional
   education. The study's objective was to analyze how they scaled their
   communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative
   experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in
   digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico.
   Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic
   thinking (z = -2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly
   higher mean ( M = 25.36) than men ( M = 25.11). Qualitative results
   support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as
   participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90\%).
   This suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively
   enhance communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they

   from the UTAUT2 model in vocational education},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAR 7},
Abstract = {Integrating advanced technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and
   Augmented Reality (AR) in educational settings can significantly enhance
   learning, especially in vocational education, where practical
   application is crucial. However, understanding the factors influencing
   student acceptance of these technologies remains challenging. This study
   examines how Heutagogical and Cybergogical Behaviors affect vocational
   high school students' intentions to use AR and VR in classrooms, with
   Virtual Experience as a mediator. By extending the UTAUT2 model, the
   research offers insights into technology adoption in vocational
   education. Conducted in July 2024 with 438 students from six Indonesian
   regencies, the study used a quantitative, non-experimental design.
   PLS-SEM analysis revealed that Heutagogical and Cybergogical activities
   significantly influenced students' performance and effort expectancy,
   increasing their intention to use AR and VR. Virtual Experience fully
   mediated the effects of performance expectancy, hedonic motivation,
   social influence, and price value on students' intentions. However,
   effort expectancy and facilitating conditions directly impacted
   behavioral intentions, underscoring the importance of ease of use and
   support in adopting these technologies. The findings suggest that
   integrating structured and self-directed learning approaches, providing
   immersive hands-on opportunities with AR/VR tools, and ensuring ease of
   use and strong institutional support can enhance technology adoption.
   These strategies align vocational training with industry demands,
   preparing students for technologically driven workplaces.},

Abstract = {Higher teacher education in European countries has undergone a
   remarkable transformation due to the constant convergence of educational
   systems and institutions of higher education in Western Europe. The aim
   of the article is to analyze the experience of using innovative
   technologies in higher pedagogical education in the European Union
   countries. Methods of analysis and synthesis, prediction, comparison,
   and abstraction were used to realize this main task. The results traced
   the main innovative technologies popular in European pedagogical
   universities. The effectiveness of interactive learning, modular
   education system, technology of level differentiation, methods of
   learning through research (use of the project method), E-learning, and
   deep use of digital platforms, which contributes to the formation of
   theoretical and practical knowledge, development of critical thinking
   and creative potential in higher education applicants is demonstrated.
   It is pointed out that e-learning based on university platforms allows
   users to actively participate in various international educational
   projects, creatively interact with other users and even create new
   content. Several European universities (from France, Germany, Austria,
   and other countries) have merged their e-learning platforms into one
   professional global service called web2.0. Important directions for the
   further development of teacher education will be heutagogy, peeragogy,
   or paragogy and cybergogy. The conclusions stressed the importance of
   further integration of digital innovative methods to teaching
   pedagogical disciplines.},

Abstract = {The Australian and New Zealand Clinician Educator Network (ANZCEN) is a
   collaborative interprofessional group developed to promote the
   development of education in critical care healthcare practice. In
   November 2018, 45 critical care practitioners met at the first ANZCEN
   Unconference. In an unconference, the participants drive the agenda, and
   learning occurs from the active process of engaging in a community of
   practice. The aim of this unconference was to develop an innovative
   approach to learning through a collaborative framework with
   interprofessional representation across critical care specialties. Four
   key themes were identified in the unconference as drivers of
   interprofessional critical care educational priorities:
   interprofessional learning, workplace learning, faculty development,
   research, and scholarship. In this discussion paper, we describe our
   experiences organizing, participating in, and evaluating an
   unconference, and we examine its usefulness as a medium for promoting
   the interprofessional learning agenda in critical care. We hope that the
   processes outlined in this discussion paper will provide a useful
   resource for other clinicians who are considering developing an
   unconference. Finally, we argue that the unconference offers a unique
   and important model for future education of critical care practitioners
   where the emphasis on collaboration and communication through
   interprofessional learning and practice will be required to improve
   health outcomes and promote a patient-centered model of care.},

Month = {2024 AUG 1},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe teaching staff learns as a result of their daily teaching
   practice, and yet there is limited knowledge regarding the impact of
   extracurricular activities within the school, such as science clubs, on
   the professional growth of science teachers.PurposeThis study is
   proposed to deepen the understanding of how teachers perceive science
   clubs, what learning they obtain from them, and what factors contribute
   to promoting this learning.SampleFive experienced science teachers
   involved in coordinating school science clubs participated in the study.
   They were all experienced science teachers with some experience in
   running a science club.Design and methodsThe study may most accurately
   be described as a descriptive-qualitative study with a comprehensive
   scope. Data was obtained through semi-structured interviews. The
   collected information was analysed from a descriptive and interpretative
   perspective using techniques specific to content analysis.ResultsThe
   results show that teachers value science clubs as an opportunity to
   enhance both their content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge, a space
   to reconsider what it means to be a science teacher, to get to know and
   connect more with their students, and to collaborate with other
   colleagues.ConclusionIt is concluded that the study provides evidence
   that the learning acquired in science club activities complements and
   expands the interviewed teachers' expertise and contributes to their
   professional development in all three dimensions: personal, social, and
   professional.},

Title = {The Middle Space: On Blogs and Beyond in Blended Learning},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {As blended learning (BL) is becoming a new normal in the context of
   higher education, there is a growing need to attune pedagogies to this
   context. As reflective blogs were found to be supportive of pre-service
   student teachers' (PSTs') as well as teacher educators' (TEs')
   professional development, the current study aimed to explore PSTs' and
   TEs' perceptions regarding the potential of integrating blogs into the
   BL modality. Applying a qualitative approach, analyses of 528 PSTs' blog
   posts, transcriptions of two focus groups with 11 PSTs, and 3 TEs'
   reflections and discussion transcripts yielded four themes that related
   to both the PSTs' and the TEs' perspectives regarding the integration of
   blogs into BL: (1) keeping sequential learning, (2) supporting
   self-directed learning, (3) keeping a sense of a learning community, and
   (4) increasing motivation and critical thinking. Nevertheless, both the
   PSTs and TEs described unique roles for blogging in BL. The TEs
   indicated that blogs support a sense of control, reveal misconceptions,
   and model teaching, while the PSTs indicated that blogs increase or
   decrease self-confidence during BL. The implications pertain to the
   contribution of blogging in BL, as well as to the four pedagogical
   principles of effective BL design: (a) continuity in learning, (b)
   fostering autonomous learning, (c) building a learning community, and
   (d) reflectivity and professional development.},

Title = {Mobile learning frameworks and pedagogy: A systematic review},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article provides a systematic review of mobile learning frameworks
   that address issues of pedagogy published between 2011 and 2022. The
   objective of the review was to gain a clear picture of recent
   developments in mobile learning frameworks to provide an understanding
   of current directions in mobile learning pedagogy. Eighteen
   peer-reviewed journal articles that presented new mobile learning
   pedagogical frameworks were examined and evaluated based on the
   characteristics of each framework. The two main areas of analysis were
   the pedagogical approaches integrated into the frameworks and their
   definitions of mobile learning. We conclude that mobile learning
   frameworks have become more diverse over time, in many cases tending to
   focus on specific aspects of mobile learning rather than attempting to
   address overarching concepts. With respect to pedagogies and their
   underlying theories of learning, social constructivism, heutagogy,
   collaborative learning, experiential learning, inquiry-based learning,
   and student-centred learning were mentioned most frequently. However,
   although many frameworks make reference to pedagogy, there is limited
   analysis of how mobile learning pedagogy might be defined as distinct
   from other contexts of learning. The key characteristics of mobile
   learning, consistent through most of the reviewed frameworks, comprise
   the portability of mobile devices across multiple contexts,
   connectivity, and accessibility, as well as learner-centredness
   (including personalisation and self-regulation). One key aspect of
   identifying the uniqueness and future potential of mobile learning is
   the special affordances addressed by mobile learning theory. We conclude
   that this is an area where further research is required.},

Title = {Using artificial intelligence in the development of self-determined
   lifelong learners in higher education: a scoping review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUL 24},
Abstract = {The rapid emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is
   profoundly reshaping teaching and learning practices in higher
   education. This shift challenges traditional pedagogical approaches and
   increasingly requires learners to develop autonomy, adaptability, and
   lifelong learning skills. As this trend accelerates, it becomes
   essential to understand how AI-driven tools and teaching approaches are
   being used to promote self-determined learning. However, the use of AI
   technologies to support the development of lifelong learning skills in
   self-determined learners is still in its early stages, underscoring the
   need for further investigation into existing learning environments.
   Therefore, this scoping review investigates AI-driven tools and
   approaches for the development of self-determined lifelong learning
   skills. This is the first scoping review to present and synthesize
   self-determined lifelong learning skills within the implementation of
   AI-driven learning environments. The results suggest that AI-driven
   technologies predominantly develop self-determined lifelong learning
   skills and competencies such as learner agency, self-efficacy and
   capability, metacognition and reflection, responsibility, digital
   competence, critical thinking, collaborative learning, problem-solving,
   employability, and self-regulated learning but do not sufficiently draw
   on non-linear learning and learning how to learn skills. In addition,
   computational thinking, with its scarcity among other skills and
   competencies, holds significant promise for future research on the
   development of self-determined lifelong skills. University instructors,
   instructional designers, and future employers can draw on these insights
   to collaborate and integrate AI-driven technologies to enhance the
   development of self-determined lifelong learners.},

Title = {Co-designing critical thinking in health professional education: a 360
   immersive environment case study},
Journal = {VIRTUAL REALITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Critical thinking is essential in health disciplines though is
   reportedly underdeveloped in student health professionals. Immersive
   mobile extended reality (mXR) may facilitate critical thinking in health
   education though has not yet been fully explored. The main aim of this
   study was to evaluate the impact of co-designing a virtual environment
   on the facilitation of critical thinking in health education students.
   Second-year graduate-entry Doctor of Physiotherapy students (n = 25)
   co-designed health-related case scenarios over six weeks in a web-based
   360-degree immersive environment. This included embedding exercise
   prescription videos that incorporated prompts for critical thinking of a
   target population. The evaluation included pre- and post-evaluation
   surveys, the Health Science Reasoning Test (HSRT-N) and the System
   Usability Scale (SUS). The results of this study demonstrated a positive
   effect on critical thinking skills- particularly in analysis,
   interpretation, inference, deduction, numeracy and overall (p < .05).
   Participants reported favourable perceptions of mXR usability and the
   learning experience, although challenges such as cybersickness and
   technical complexities were noted. Peer feedback suggested that the
   virtual environment promoted engagement and authenticity in learning.
   Recommendations for future iterations include enhancing population
   representation, addressing challenges in system usability, and refining
   instructional design elements. Overall, the study demonstrates the
   potential of mobile immersive reality to enhance critical thinking and
   foster authentic learning experiences in health education. Further
   design principles and implications for research design are proposed in
   the study.},

Title = {Learning through relationships: The transformative learning experience
   of midwifery continuity of care for students: A qualitative study},
Journal = {WOMEN AND BIRTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {385-392},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Midwifery curricula in Australia incorporate `Continuity of
   care experiences' (CoCE) as an educa-tional strategy based on an
   assumption that midwifery students will learn skills and knowledge about
   woman -centred care that they may not learn in the typical fragmented
   care system. However, exactly what skills and knowledge they are
   expected to `learn' and how these can be assessed have never been
   specifically identified. Aim: To explore midwifery students' continuity
   of care learning experiences within pre-registration midwifery
   education.Methods: Focus groups were conducted with first, second and
   third year Bachelor of Midwifery students (n = 12), who were undertaking
   CoCE in rural and regional tertiary hospitals in NSW,
   Australia.Findings: The overarching theme, `Learning through
   relationships', was made up of three interrelated themes: Meeting women
   and making connections, Being known, and Understanding holistic
   care.Discussion: The findings from this study contribute to
   understanding the educational effects of CoCE. The CoCE relationship
   provided safety and freedom to learn which was seen as foundational for
   midwifery students' vision of their future practice and can be seen as a
   self-determined transformational approach to learning.Conclusion: This
   study adds insight into midwifery students' experience of CoCE, and
   demonstrates that trans -formative learning occurs through developing a
   relationship with both the woman and the midwife. For midwifery to
   develop as a profession and maintain its focus on woman-centredness, it
   is important that this aspect of midwifery education remains embedded
   within midwifery program philosophies and learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {TVET in Malaysia is geared toward providing quality education, training,
   and resources but it still needs to be strengthened and reformed toward
   producing a more quality and skilled workforce. This study aimed to
   procure feedback from TVET curriculum key-players' (automotive) on the
   integration of automotive case-based simulation (CBS) as TVET future
   learning strategies. Collective case-study research design was used with
   purposive sampling design which involved 5 curriculum key-players in
   vocational college and 16 automotive industries as study respondents. A
   set of questionnaires and interview protocols were used to gather
   quantitative and qualitative data. Intra-class correlation coefficient
   (ICC) was used to obtain an average measure agreement among raters.
   ATLAS.ti was also used through thematic analysis to produce models. The
   ICC showed high values of agreement for the process and structure of the
   CBS. The limitation of this research focused on one program (automotive
   technology) through the key-players' and industries' perspectives toward
   the implementation of CBS as a tool to enhance students' soft skills.
   The collation of both data showed the alignment between both parties
   against the CBS. The curriculum key-players agreed that CBS fulfilled
   its requirements as a tool to enrich TVET students' marketability
   skills, supported by the automotive industries' perspective which
   believed that using CBS would prepare TVET students' readiness to the
   workplace. Notably, the CBS provides an opportunity to stimulate
   thinking and learning preferences among students, in addition to being a
   learning tool for future TVET learning strategies that connect theory
   and practice in preparation for job training.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with utilization of selected social media where learning
   management system plays a comprehensive and stable role in the
   teaching/learning process in the university setting. The goal of the
   paper is to show the acceptance and a level of appropriateness of social
   media for study purposes perceived by students. Results from three
   consecutive studies form the backbone of the presented paper showing the
   trends in the acceptance of social media and satisfaction with them. Two
   areas are analysed: social media as a means of communication in the
   process of education and social media as a tool enabling students'
   revision and testing of study materials. This kind of research
   corresponds to the increased need to develop desired self-study skills
   in students, especially in the context of Covid19 experience. The first
   studies, which were conducted in 2014 and 2019, are based on the
   identical set of examined social media and fit the comparison enabling
   to define the trend in students' satisfaction with social media for
   study purposes. The third study discussed in this paper was run during
   winter semester of 2021. The set of examined social media in the
   questionnaire was adapted to reflect the current social media scene.
   Experience with the abrupt shift to online platforms caused by global
   crisis has significantly affected the process of education exposing and
   endorsing the power of heutagogy. The situation prompted the need to
   emphasize the importance of autonomous education and ability to define
   educational needs and ways of achieving study goals.},

   emotional expressions and vocal charisma in asynchronous video-based

Abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of higher education and adult
   learning, asynchronous video-based online learning has not only become
   the new norm but has also emerged as the cornerstone of instructional
   delivery for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Despite its widespread
   adoption, this learning mode confronts a critical challenge: the
   inherent lack of social presence, posing a significant risk of
   diminishing learner affective engagement and, consequently, jeopardizing
   the efficacy of learning outcomes. Addressing this pressing issue, our
   study conducted a comprehensive analysis of 240 instructional videos
   from 240 distinct instructors on a MOOC platform, supplemented by 845
   post-course learner feedback surveys from a diverse cohort of college
   students and adult learners. Using deep learning and statistical
   analysis, the research revealed that the on-screen presence of
   instructors does not inherently affect students' affective engagement.
   The study revealed that learners' affective engagement is affected by
   distinct combinations of the instructor's facial and paraverbal
   expressions, including happiness, surprise, and anger, which vary
   depending on whether the instructor is visible. The discovery that vocal
   attractiveness is a pivotal element in enhancing learners' affective
   engagement with instructional videos marks a paradigm shift in our
   understanding of digital andragogy and heutagogy. This study propels
   academic discourse by illuminating the critical role of instructor
   non-verbal cues in establishing social presence and facilitating
   emotional contagion within asynchronous video-based online learning but
   also provides educators and content creators with empirically-backed
   techniques to revolutionize video instruction and amplify affective
   engagement.},

Abstract = {Universities play a crucial role in building the economic development
   capacity for their communities and regions. Their capacity building role
   is typically defined by contributions to the economic bottom line of the
   community and region where a university is located. This kind of
   capacity building may find itself in conflict with the long-term
   sustainable development needs of the region and with the responsibility
   of the university itself. Sustainable capacity building may require
   strategies that focus on the specific social, cultural, environmental,
   and physical context of a university's location beyond purely economic
   capacity goals. To achieve sustainable development outcomes,
   universities must advance an understanding of the context conditions
   within which they are located. At least three context systems are
   relevant to this view of development: the economy, society and culture,
   and the environment with its physical, biological, and ecological
   context conditions. Each of these context systems is characterized by
   distinct time frames, spatial configurations, rules, and success
   measures. A focus on economic development outcomes reflects only one
   subsystem's rules, behaviors, and success measures. By analyzing two
   case study examples from the United States and South Africa, we offer a
   framework for universities to advance sustainability objectives that
   correspond to their broader responsibilities. We argue that in order to
   meet these broader responsibilities, universities must first commit to
   giving expression to their own local context through the voices and
   lived realities of students and residents. Since universities build the
   brain trust of communities and regions around the world, they play an
   essential role in strengthening global sustainability goals by building
   the local capacity of their communities and regions.},

Title = {(Re)framing a philosophical and epistemological framework for teaching

Abstract = {Today's learners are engaging in study where access to knowledge is
   easier than it ever has been in human history. Rapid advancement of
   technology and the increasing ease with which communication and
   interaction can occur has dramatically changed the landscape in which
   teachers of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
   operate. The contemporary skills that students are required to possess
   include inter alia problem solving, creativity, teamwork abilities,
   communication skills and emotional intelligence. Despite the universal
   acceptance of their importance, these skills are commonly cited as
   underdeveloped and in addition, are still accompanied by outmoded
   `traditional' forms of teaching and assessment. While the approaches of
   twentieth-century education were successful in developing knowledge
   stores, the ubiquity of access to knowledge-coupled with the constantly
   changing nature of the world today-requires alternative conceptions of
   teaching and learning. This article focuses primarily on an exploration
   of learning metaphors and teaching with the overall lens of creating
   self-regulated and furthermore, self-determined learners. The article
   begins with an exploration of learning in STEM education and a critique
   of the pedagogical perspective, discussing why this epistemology may be
   insufficient for contemporary STEM learning. The article then considers
   an alternative and potentially more contemporary notion; the emergent
   pedagogic space. The article presents a theoretical model to
   conceptualise learning in STEM education, with the goal of informing
   both practice and research. The realisation of this proposed emergent
   pedagogical space is explored through an applied case study from a
   design and technology context.},

Abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) made the promise of offering
   unrestrictive and unselective educational opportunities to learners
   worldwide. However, the specific learning environment of the MOOC
   requires high autonomy and flexibility in learning. MOOC learners are
   extremely diverse in terms of their age, qualifications, background and
   in the ability of self-regulating their learning. In this study, we
   aimed at having a better understanding of learners' readiness for
   self-determined learning in a Language MOOC context. Our objective was
   to select and characterize highly self-determined learners and to
   examine the relationship between self-determined learning
   characteristics of this specific learner cohort. We applied a battery of
   instruments measuring self-directed learning readiness, self-reflection
   and insight, self-efficacy and internet skills. Highly self-determined
   learners were selected by applying criteria based on the reported level
   of confidence in learners' skills on the agreement scales. The Pearson
   correlation was used to examine the relationship between self-directed
   learning readiness and self-reflection and insight, self-efficacy and
   internet skills. Our results showed that only 4.31\% of the participants
   fulfilled our established criteria. The correlation tests revealed that
   there are significant correlations among the self-determined learning
   elements: we found significant positive correlation between,
   self-directed learning readiness and insight, self-efficacy, information
   navigation internet skill ; between desire for learning and insight,
   engagement in reflection; desire for learning and need for reflection,
   information navigation; between self-management and mobile internet
   skill;and between self-control and self-efficacy. Based on the results,
   implications and suggestion for MOOC design are provided.},

Title = {Adult Learning as Metamorphosis and Popular Education for Lesbian, Gay,

   Leonard Matlovich},
Journal = {ADULT LEARNING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Critical events in Leonard Matlovich's life depict a reluctant activist
   for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/gender diverse, and queer+
   (LGBTQ+) equality. He served in the US military and subsequently came to
   personify the broad social challenges to the military's homophobic
   culture and recruitment practices. Matlovich's experience of a series of
   life metamorphoses made a difference beyond the individual. His example
   inspired multitudes of other concerned citizens in how to undertake
   their metamorphoses to challenge institutionalized homophobia.
   Breakthrough learning experiences in Matlovich's life are presented to
   explore and refine aspects of transformative learning theory by applying
   Jane Martin's metamorphosis model. The learning nexus between
   individuals and society is shown to be a dynamic interaction where both
   aspects of Matlovich's story and his influence are explored in the
   context of today's LGBTQ+ equality struggles. The article shows the
   conducive personal and societal conditions that enabled his various
   metamorphoses as whole-of-individual identity and sociocultural
   crossings toward transformational change. Additionally, the implications
   of Martin's educational metamorphosis are discussed. Adult educators are
   encouraged to emphasize learning located in the learner's life
   circumstances, exemplary case studies to inspire cultural crossings
   against injustice, and transformations as being about grasping in situ
   learning opportunities in the cross-influence between the whole person
   and their sociohistorical context. Matlovich's experiences show how
   relevant dimensions of Martin's theoretical approach, coupled with
   support from allies, can contribute to personal agency and can build a
   groundswell of learning needed to support activism for social justice
   movements.},

Title = {Building a risky-safe-space: Using refllective pedagogies and values to

Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The concepts of `graduateness' and graduate attributes became contested
   terrain before COVID-19 destabilised even the most assured of shared
   learning constructions. Indeed, for those of us immersed in the delivery
   of work-based learning (WBL), this has long been the case. Promotion of
   reductive notions of `skills' acquisition to comply neatly with an
   employability agenda holds little relevance for those students already
   engaged in full time careers, and with a wealth of professional
   experience. What can hold influence and interest, however, is the
   opportunity to engage in meaningful, agentic, professionally-aligned
   reflective practices as a scaffolded route to promoting self-awareness
   and developing confidence in mapping competences from the professional
   domain to the academic (and vice versa).This paper shares an account of
   taking an embedded approach to supporting the development of academic
   literacies amongst work-based learners in one UK HEI. In particular, it
   will consider the use of reflective pedagogical tools and values in
   supporting work-based learners to become confident and adaptable
   writers. Discussion considers how work-based pedagogies and approaches
   may have far-reaching relevance in a post-pandemic landscape, where
   reskilling and professional agility are likely to become more prolific
   aspects of education and work. Writing itself is framed as an integrated
   communication practice that encompasses literature retrieval, reading,
   evaluation, synthesis and articulation of argument. The paper will
   describe pre-pandemic academic support activities and share qualitative
   survey data in which students consider their confidence as both
   professional and academic writers. It concludes with consideration of
   how some of the approaches outlined may have relevance for the wider
   academic community.},

Journal = {LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article shows how the self-determined learning environment in
   Paths, an innovative teacher-education (TE) program, enables students to
   experience meaningful learning which reinforces their mental wellbeing
   and resilience. According to the self-determination theory (SDT), a
   central goal of such a learning environment is to support students'
   three basic emotional and social needs of self-capacity, autonomy, and
   relatedness and connections with others. While the Paths program trains
   the students to be high-school teachers, and coaches them to be mentors
   for youth at risk (YAR), about half of these students define themselves
   as having been YAR who suffered from a low level of resilience and
   mental wellbeing in their adolescence. Using the self-determined
   learning environment, Paths fosters students as self-determined learners
   in many courses which use methods like Project-Based Learning (PBL),
   Self-Determined Learning (Heutagogy), Outdoor Training (ODT), and
   Self-Management Learning (SML). In keeping with the qualitative
   multiple-case study method, semi-structured interviews with four Paths
   graduates and examples of other graduates' learning presentations
   demonstrated that graduates' learning experiences supported their
   emotional and social needs and strengthened their feelings of resilience
   and mental wellbeing during and after the learning. The graduates
   testified that this learning environment helped them to become
   entrepreneurs and empowering educators, as well as social and
   environmental activists. These findings reveal the productive
   contribution of the self-determined learning environment to students'
   development as teachers and YAR mentors, and as social and environmental
   leaders.},

Abstract = {Purpose To date, didactic lecturing is a common method of university
   medical training. However, higher levels of competence to solve complex
   issues are hardly to be achieved with a largely passive learning style.
   We established and evaluated a heutagogical blended learning concept to
   investigate self-determined learning with a multimedia-based,
   interactive approach in the lecture room to teach clinical radiology.
   Materials and Methods In the 2019/2020 winter semester, we included 266
   medical students in their fourth academic year in our prospective,
   observational study. Students participated in a series of 11
   radiological lectures given by 10 lecturers. They were requested to
   prepare for lectures by watching learning videos. During the lecture,
   students had to answer key-feature questions (KFQ) in small groups and
   to jointly submit their answers by means of an audience response system
   (ARS). After each lecture and the exam, we conducted surveys and
   compared results with a historical control group. A focus group
   interview with lecturers was performed after conclusion of the lecture
   series.
   Results The students' overall impression of the ``flipped classroom{''}
   concept and their examination grades were superior to historical
   controls (overall impression: 1.5 {[}95 \% CI 1.4-1.6] vs. 2.7 {[}95 \%
   CI 2.5-2.9] rated on a scale from 1 to 6, p < 0.001; examination grades:
   1.8 {[}95 \% CI 1.7-1.9] vs. 2.0 {[} 95 \% CI 1.9-2.0] rated on a scale
   from 1 to 5, p < 0.001). Most students agreed that learning videos (76.6
   \%), ARS ( 88.5 \%), KFQ (76.5 \%), and solution-oriented small group
   discussions (83.7 \%) were useful. Lecturers stated an improved
   convergence of demands on learning and clinical competence. However,
   they also emphasized an increased initial effort for implementation.
   Conclusion Students rated the overall benefit from the heutagogical
   ``flipped classroom{''} concept as high. Examination grades improved.
   According to lecturers, the ``flipped classroom{''} concept better
   matched later professional demands than traditional lectures.},

Title = {Psycho-social drivers influencing the adoption of asynchronous EdTech
   tools: a gendered perspective},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to explore a gendered perspective on
   how learners' intrinsic psychological motivators: valence,
   technology-innovativeness, self-development and self-efficacy as well as
   extrinsic social and institutional motivators, such as social norms and
   management commitment, collectively influence learners' behavioral
   intention to adopt asynchronous EdTech tools such as
   MOOCs.Design/methodology/approachA theoretical model was developed by
   integrating insights from social cognitive theory (SCT) and the
   technology acceptance model (TAM). Data were collected from 622 Indian
   college students across different academic levels who had enrolled in at
   least one MOOC. Data analysis was performed using covariance-based
   structural equation modeling (CB-SEM). The bootstrapping method using
   IBM AMOS 23.0 software was adopted further for moderation
   analysis.FindingsThe study found that while intrinsic drivers were
   positively associated with behavioral intention, extrinsic drivers had a
   limited influence. The results of the moderation analysis showed that
   gender significantly influenced the relationship between
   self-development and perceived usefulness as well as the relationship
   between valence and perceived usefulness. Our study's findings represent
   a significant contribution to theoretical advancements, indicating a
   notable shift in students' learning emphasis from social interactions to
   self-directed approaches. These results align closely with the
   principles of connectivism within the heutagogy theory framework,
   underscoring learners' responsibility in shaping their learning
   journey.Practical implicationsOur study findings hold significant
   practical implications for future applications. Based on our study's
   findings on the positive impact of self-development and self-efficacy,
   it is crucial to offer structured and interactive learning options for
   guided experiences. Integrating digital skills training into MOOC
   curricula can enhance engagement across diverse learner levels, given
   the significant predictive power of technology innovativeness.
   Furthermore, emphasizing the benefits of MOOC certifications, such as
   career advancement or academic recognition, can increase their appeal
   and perceived value, considering the significance of ``valence{''} as an
   influential factor.Originality/valueAsynchronous EdTech tools, notably
   MOOCs, have emerged as potent catalysts for social change, providing
   unparalleled accessibility, flexibility and avenues for lifelong
   learning. Our study pioneers an investigation into the impact of valence
   and technology innovativeness on learners' perceptions, significantly
   influencing their willingness to adopt MOOCs positively. By exploring
   nuanced sociological dynamics across diverse societies, our research
   underscores the necessity of customizing EdTech solutions to encompass
   diverse gender perspectives.},

Title = {Impact of guided self-study on learning success in undergraduate
   physiotherapy students in Switzerland - a feasibility study of a higher
   education intervention},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Background: Guided self-study (G-SS) can be used as a self-directed
   learning method or self-determined learning that fosters changes in
   knowledge and skills in a higher physiotherapy education setting. Until
   now, there has been no empirical evidence for the use of G-SS in higher
   physiotherapy education. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility
   to establish a G-SS program in a fulltime undergraduate physiotherapy
   degree course. In addition, the effectiveness of the G-SS was assessed
   on changes in knowledge and skills.
   Method: Fifty-one first-semester physiotherapy students were randomly
   divided into a G-SS group or control group (CG). The G-SS group received
   six clinical cases. Each case was processed in an eight-day cycle. One
   week in advance, the clinical case were provided to the students
   electronically (day 1). The students prepared the cases in groups and
   were guided by the tutor during this preparation time (day 2 to 7).
   Group work results were presented and reflected on during a moderated
   plenum session at day 8. A priori criteria of success were defined based
   on empirical experience for the primary outcome parameters i) exposure,
   ii) responsiveness of students and iii) program differentiation. The
   secondary outcome was the total score in the objective structured
   clinical examination (OSCE) and written exams. Statistical analyses were
   conducted using SPSS.
   Results: The responsiveness of students as willing to participate in the
   G-SS program was 23\%, clearly below the a priori set 83\%. No
   differences in program differentiation were found. G-SS as compared to
   the CG scored significantly better on OSCE (p = 0.003) and on the
   written exam (p = 0.004).
   Conclusion: The results showed that this higher education G-SS program
   in its current form was not feasible. Slight modification of the study
   protocol (e.g. better time planning in the academic calendar) is needed
   to improve the student's responsiveness. The adjustments to the
   timetable must allow the physiotherapy students to prepare the clinical
   cases under conditions of lower workload. G-SS has the potential to
   promote change in knowledge and skills in undergraduate physiotherapy
   students when students prepare and present the clinical case solutions
   and reflect upon their actions.},

Title = {Acceptance of Social Media for Study Purposes-A Longitudinal Case Study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Background: Social media is a ubiquitous phenomenon that serves as a
   tool for communication, collaboration, and creativity. In the long term,
   it has an indispensable place in the field of education. The research
   paper discusses the use of certain social networking sites where
   learning management systems are extensively and consistently used in the
   teaching and learning process at universities. The rapid transition to
   online platforms had a tremendous impact on the educational process,
   exposing and promoting the effectiveness of heutagogy. The circumstances
   made it necessary to emphasize the value of self-directed learning and
   the capacity to identify educational requirements and strategies for
   reaching study objectives. This kind of research corresponds to the
   increased need to develop desired self-study skills in students.
   Objectives: The goal of the paper is to demonstrate how undergraduate
   students perceive the trends in acceptance and the degree of
   appropriateness of social media for academic purposes. Methods: Research
   on social media use in education was inspired by a review of the
   literature. The purpose of the questionnaire is to track awareness, use,
   general satisfaction, communication, testing, and revision. The set of
   social media examined in the survey (years 2021 and 2022) was modified
   to reflect the social media landscape at the time. This study compares
   the findings of four different studies. The outcomes are displayed in
   graphs. Results: Two areas are analyzed: social media as a means of
   communication in the process of education and social media as a tool
   enabling students' revision and testing of study materials. The first
   two studies, which were conducted in 2014 and 2019, are based on the
   same set of examined social media and fit the comparison, enabling to
   define the trend in students' perceived satisfaction with social media
   for study purposes. The third and fourth studies discussed in this paper
   were run during the winter semesters of 2021 and 2022. Conclusions: The
   most significant differences between 2021 and 2022 can be seen in
   Instagram, Twitch, and other platforms, where a substantial drop in
   satisfaction in the communication field can be seen. The biggest
   difference in revision and testing is found in Facebook, Twitch, and
   Teams, which are abandoning online teaching and learning after the
   COVID-19 event. Social media use for studying has significantly
   decreased, with noteworthy decreases in Wiki, Facebook, and video calls.},

Abstract = {Purpose To determine the perceived self-efficacy of South African LIS
   academics in e-teaching as a co-requisite to imparting relevant ICT
   knowledge and skills to LIS students. Design/methodology/approach The
   study was underpinned by the pragmatic world view, which allows a
   researcher to choose a combination of methods, techniques and procedures
   that best meets the needs and purposes of the study. Based on the
   purpose and objectives of the study, and the type of data needed, a
   quantitative approach, employing the descriptive survey design was used.
   An online questionnaire with both structured and unstructured questions
   was distributed to 79 LIS academics in 8 universities and attracted a
   68.4\% response rate. Structured responses were computed directly as
   quantitative data, while the unstructured answers were aggregated under
   themes and analysed quantitatively. Findings The findings show that LIS
   academics in South Africa have not been left behind in the trends
   regarding e-teaching, and most of them feel quite confident about their
   self-efficacy in e-teaching. A variety of Learning Management Systems
   and e-tools are in use and relevant policies and technical support
   available. Most LIS academics, to re-/up-skill themselves, employ
   diverse heutagogical strategies. However, the e-teaching support in
   terms of resources and technical support are inadequate because some
   universities are deficient in their provision of ICTs and e-learning
   guidelines. Research limitations/implications The limitations of the
   study is that this was a time-bound study that focused merely on the
   basic level investigation A further in-depth probing of the real (as
   opposed to self) levels of e-teaching efficacy and how heutagogy can be
   explored or advocated is necessary. Practical implications The
   implications of the results are that (1) South African LIS academics are
   well fairly well prepares to face the impact of COVID-19, which has
   forced universities to turn to virtual/online education (2) Heutagogical
   approach should be explored as a method of further improving the
   capabilities of e-teachers, in order to (3) pass forward a positive
   impact on LIS graduates by preparing them to be agile for a modern work
   environment. (4) universities have to provide sufficient resources to
   support academics in their endeavour to continually improve their
   teaching. Social implications Topical in the face of the novel
   coronavirus. Originality/value Optimal},

Abstract = {Background: Self-directed learning or self-determined learning can be
   used in guided self-study (GSS) as an educational method with the goal
   to promote changes in the knowledge and skills of undergraduate
   physiotherapy students in higher education. Until now, there has been a
   lack of empirical evidence for the usage of GSS in physiotherapy higher
   education. At the Division of Physiotherapy in the Department of Health
   Professions (Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH), Switzerland) the
   module `basic examination' - in the form of an objective structured
   examination (OSCE) and written exam - is scheduled in the first semester
   of the educational program.
   Objective: The primary aim of this study is to examine the feasibility
   of establishing GSS in an undergraduate physiotherapy degree program at
   the BFH. Secondary aim is to assess the effectiveness of GSS on the
   examination skills of first-semester undergraduate physiotherapy
   students will.
   Method: This paper describes the protocol of a randomized
   group-controlled educational feasibility study. 51 physiotherapy
   students from the first semester will be allocated into a guided
   self-study group (GSSG) or control group. The GSS takes place during the
   first semester, and consists of an eight-day cycle, with a presentation
   on the last day. Duration of this presentation is 90min with supervision
   from a university lecturer. One week in advance of the presentation, the
   case and the learning goals are provided to the students electronically.
   The students prepare the cases in groups of five to six. The students
   are guided by the tutor during this preparation time. During a moderated
   plenum session, students present the results of group work and reflect
   upon the preparation phase and learning steps. Feasibility outcomes
   include the fidelity of implementation through exposure dosage,
   students' responsiveness, program differentiation, and the degree of
   acceptability. Success criteria of feasibility are (1) exposure dosage
   as the number of 90-minute presentations that are conducted, and the
   content of cases and competences, (2) students' responsiveness, with the
   aim of 100\% willingness to participate, and (3) program
   differentiation, which will illustrate the alignment between GSS case
   content and the curriculum. Acceptability of intervention from the
   students' perspective will be evaluated by a semi-structured interview.
   Secondary outcomes will be the achieved grades in the OSCE exams and
   written exams that demonstrate learning success.
   Conclusion: This feasibility study assesses the fidelity of
   implementation, the degree of acceptability and the effectiveness of GSS
   sessions on examination skills in undergraduate physiotherapy students
   at the BFH. Furthermore, this study will demonstrate whether guided
   self-study is feasible and can be implemented with fidelity in the BFH
   physiotherapy higher education curriculum.},

Title = {Are undergraduate students studying smart? Insights into study
   strategies and habits across a programme of study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The approach that students take in their studies at university is
   critical not only for their academic success but is equally important in
   life-long learning for their career and professional development.
   Heutagogy is the study of self-determined learning and it is important
   that we appraise how students in higher education are developing their
   metacognitive awareness in how they learn and study effectively.
   Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary research area that involves
   the scientific study of the human mind. It helps provide new knowledge
   in relation to areas such as memory, problem solving, knowledge transfer
   and understanding of complex topics. Cognitive science has demonstrated
   that re-testing oneself on material when learning, enhances and promotes
   greater retention of knowledge compared to re-reading the material.
   Learning that is distributed or spaced out over multiple study sessions
   also allows for greater retention of knowledge in the longer-term
   compared to `cramming' of information. To evaluate the use of effective
   study approaches and habits across three different levels of study in an
   undergraduate pharmacy programme, a survey study was employed. A
   paper-based survey was completed by first-, second- and third-year
   undergraduate pharmacy students (n=192) during class sessions. Although
   there was some evidence of metacognitive awareness such as using testing
   (retrieval practice) with practice problems; across all years,
   suboptimal study approaches such as rereading, copying notes and
   cramming were endorsed. A schedule of deadlines shaped the organisation
   of study and time management for most students. Self-testing was
   predominantly used to test learning rather than an approach used during
   learning. There was evidence of a difference between the cohorts in
   relation to decisions for prioritizing studying, returning to review
   course material and re-reading. The evidence from this study
   demonstrates that learners would require training on metacognitive
   awareness and effective study strategies to enable their self-determined
   learning capabilities to evolve. The linear progression through a
   programme of study alone will not achieve this. There is a need to embed
   and emphasize effective strategies for learning into curricula and for
   faculty to utilise metacognitive awareness in their teaching.
   Practitioner Notes
   1. Self-determined learning places an expectation that learners
   self-regulate and take responsibility for their learning. Student's
   independent study within a programme helps to consolidate learning.
   2. Study habits and preferences vary among individuals however there is
   clear evidence from cognitive science that not all study approaches are
   effective.
   3. Undergraduate students are using suboptimal study methods such as
   rereading notes, recopying notes and cramming information the night
   before a test. Self-testing was predominantly used to test learning
   rather than an approach used during learning.
   4. Students report that they are not using approaches taught to them by
   teachers. It has been shown that learners incorrectly predict suboptimal
   methods as superior to evidencebased approaches. We suggest that
   evidence-based study approaches are explicitly emphasised and embedded
   within courses.
   5. We recommend to senior managers with learning and teaching remits
   (Directors of Learning and Teaching, Pro Vice-Chancellors for Education
   and Student Experience) that faculty staff are informed about
   evidence-based learning approaches from cognitive science and increase
   metacognitive awareness in their teaching.},

Title = {Planning and Implementation of Guided Self-study in an Undergraduate
   Physiotherapy Curriculum in Switzerland-A Feasibility Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Self-directed learning (andragogy) or self-determined
   learning (heutagogy) can be implemented in guided self-study (GSS) with
   the aim to foster changes in the knowledge and skills of physiotherapy
   students in a higher education setting. To date, there is a lack of
   evidence for the use of GSS in higher education for physiotherapy.
   Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of developing and
   implementing GSS in an undergraduate physiotherapy educational program
   in Switzerland. In addition, the effectiveness of GSS in bringing
   changes in knowledge and skills was assessed.
   Method: Full-time undergraduate physiotherapy students (n = 49) from the
   third semester volunteered in this feasibility study. Students were
   randomly allocated into a GSS group or a control group (CG) in the
   period from October to November 2019. The GSS group prepared a total of
   3 clinical cases. Each case was processed in an 8-day cycle. On day 1,
   the clinical case (ie, description of a patient and symptoms) and
   learning goals were provided to the students electronically. The
   students prepared the cases in groups from days 2 to 7. They were guided
   2 times by the tutor (physical meeting and via Skype) during this
   preparation phase. The results of group work were presented and
   reflected on during a moderated plenum session (90 minutes) on day 8.
   The feasibility of this higher education study was operationalized as
   follows: exposure ({''}dose,{''} ie, the number of GSS sessions
   performed over 90 minutes, as well as the content of the cases and the
   learning objectives); students' responsiveness, with an a priori set
   100\% willingness to participate on day 8; program differentiation, to
   illustrate differences between the content of GSS cases and the
   curriculum; and degree of acceptability. In addition, an assessment was
   made of the total scores in the objective structured clinical
   examination (OSCE) and written examinations, as well as the amount of
   GSS. Statistical analyses were conducted using an intention-to-treat
   approach.
   Results: All 3 GSS sessions on day 8 lasted the scheduled 90 minutes.
   The content of the presented cases was aligned with the learning
   objectives. The responsiveness of students willing to participate on day
   8 was 42\%. In program differentiation, no differences in content were
   found between the GSS presentation content and the usual curriculum
   content when compared with the learning aims. Objective structured
   clinical examination grades and written examination grades were similar
   for the GSS and CG. The analysis of the focus group interview showed a
   low degree of acceptability indicating that the students' workload was
   high during the GSS period.
   Conclusions: This study showed that this GSS program for undergraduate
   physiotherapy students in its current form is ``feasible with
   modification.{''} Modification of the study protocol (eg, better time
   planning in the academic calendar) is needed to improve the students'
   responsiveness. Alternatively, classroom hours may be reduced to favor
   self-study time. Such adjustments to the timetable should allow the
   physiotherapy students to better prepare the clinical cases. The
   effectiveness of the GSS and normal curriculum on OSCE and written
   examination scores was similar, probably due to the observed low
   students' acceptability},

Title = {Universities without Walls: A Blended Delivery Approach to Training the
   Next Generation of HIV Researchers in Canada},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {(1) Background: Although HIV has not diminished in importance in Canada,
   the field of HIV research remains small, and the graduate students who
   decide to pursue careers within it feel isolated and uncertain about
   their professional skills and opportunities. Universities Without Walls
   (UWW) was created in 2009 to help redress these shortcomings. This paper
   presents a case study of UWW, a non-credit training program for emerging
   HIV researchers in Canada. In particular, we focus on the possibilities
   of experiential learning via online and blended delivery. UWW uses both
   online and in-person teaching modalities to teach engaged scholarship,
   interdisciplinarity, community-based research (CBR), intervention
   research, and ethics. (2) Methods: Using a case study, we elucidated the
   research question: ``What are the factors that make Universities Without
   Walls a viable training environment in the contemporary HIV/AIDS
   field?{''} Focus groups were conducted with 13 UWW key stakeholders in
   2012 during a program mid-point evaluation; in 2014, telephone or
   in-person interviews with the three directors were conducted by a UWW
   fellow (the 4th author of this paper), and in 2019 the authors analyzed
   the information and anecdotal evidence, which had been incorporated as
   thick description. In addition, fellows' self-assessments via portfolio
   and results from formal learning assessments were included. We also
   thematically analyzed 65 student self-reports (2009-2015). (3) Results
   and Discussion: Each UWW cohort lasted 9 months to one year and was
   comprised of: a) sustained mentorship from the co-directors (e.g., phone
   conversations, assistance with grant writing, letters of reference,
   etc.); b) fortnightly online webinars that aim to develop fellows'
   knowledge of community-based research (CBR), research ethics,
   intervention research, and interdisciplinary research; c) community
   service learning in the form of a ``field mentoring placement{''}; d)
   face-to-face engagement with fellows and mentors, most notably at the
   week-long culminating learning institute; e) a stipend for fellows to
   carry out their training activities. The UWW pedagogical framework
   features experiential learning, critical pedagogy, and heutagogy made
   manifest in the field mentoring placements (community service learning),
   mentorship mediated by technologies, and in-person learning institutes.
   Our analysis showed that experiential learning was imparted by UWW's a)
   transparency about its ``implicit curriculum{''}, the attitudes, values,
   character, and professional identity imparted in the program as well as
   the overarching programmatic elements, such as commitment to diversity,
   the inclusion of those with lived experience, the flexible admissions
   policies and procedures, interdisciplinary faculty, flexible team,
   administrative structure, and valuing of technology in conducting
   research, learning, and teaching; b) curriculum co-designing and
   co-teaching, and c) sustaining a community of practice. The main results
   reported in our case study included significant ``soft outcomes{''} for
   UWW fellows, such as developing a ``social presence{''} as a precursor
   to lasting professional connections; learning to experience
   community-based research, intersectionality, and interdisciplinarity by
   interacting online with persons living with HIV, leaders in the field,
   and a variety of stakeholders (including nonprofit staff and
   policymakers).
   (4) Limitations: While fellows' self-evaluation data were collected by
   an independent assessor and anonymized to the extent this was possible,
   the co-authors inevitably bring their preconceptions and positive biases
   to UWW's assessment. As UWW was developed to function outside of
   traditional academic structures, it is unlikely that the UWW program
   could be transferred to a post-secondary environment in its entirety.
   UWW was also built for the socio-political environment of HIV health
   research. (5) Conclusions: The experiences of those involved with UWW
   demonstrate that explicit curricular components-such as
   interdisciplinarity, community-based research, intervention research,
   and applied ethics-can be learned through a blended delivery when
   combined with opportunities to apply the knowledge in ways, such as a
   field mentoring placement and a learning institute. Related to this
   outcome, our case study describes that implicit curricular components in
   the formation of a professional-the sense of self in the field as a
   researcher, student, and community member-can also be delivered through
   a blended model. However, the tools and activities need to be tailored
   to each student for their context, while pushing their disciplinarian
   and professional boundaries.},
