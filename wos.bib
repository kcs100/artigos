Title = {Determined learning approach: Implications of heutagogy society based
   learning},
Journal = {COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2},
Abstract = {Recently, within the higher education system in the United Kingdom,
   there has been close examination of the way institutions teach and
   assess students. This scrutiny has been intensified by central
   government with the proposed introduction of the Teaching Excellence
   Framework (TEF). The anticipated TEF demands that higher education
   institutions evaluate their teaching and learning practices and think of
   new ways to develop excellent student experience. Self-determined
   learning has resurfaced as a popular approach in the higher education
   sector. At the centre of self-determined learning is the concept of
   heutagogy. This approach enables the student to apply what they have
   learned in an education setting and relate it to the workplace. The aim
   of this paper is to critically explore the theoretical framework behind
   the self-determined learning approach. The authors of this paper argue
   that, from a social science perspective, a determined learning approach
   is in the best place to provide a contemporary, exciting teaching and
   learning experience in a competitive higher education market.},

Title = {Psychometric Properties Assessment of Postgraduate Self-Determined
   Learning Questionnaire (PSLQ): A Mixed Method Approach},
Journal = {SAGE OPEN},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Postgraduate students need to be equipped with self-determined learning
   skills in order to meet the demands of higher degree and employment in
   the fourth industrial revolution (IR 4.0) environment. However, the lack
   of analysis conducted on item level for validating the measurement of
   postgraduate students' self-determined learning skills prompted the
   development of The Postgraduate Self-determined Learning Questionnaire
   (PSLQ) to fill in the research gaps. This paper aimed to assess the
   psychometric properties of the newly developed 42-item instrument
   through a mixed method approach as no study has evaluated the
   psychometric properties of PSLQ at the item level through Rasch model
   analysis. Quantitatively, 440 postgraduate students were sampled from a
   higher education institution in Malaysia to answer the questionnaire.
   Qualitatively, 10 respondents from science and non-science disciplines
   were interviewed. The paper reports findings on the psychometric
   properties of PSLQ through Rasch Rating Analysis and participants'
   perspectives on the item validity. The results revealed that the items
   in PSLQ demonstrated good psychometric properties for the measurement of
   self-determined learning skills of postgraduate students. Implications
   of the study were discussed in this paper. Future studies can further
   investigate the psychometric properties of PSLQ according to students'
   discipline of study.
   Self-determined learning is a crucial skill for postgraduate students in
   higher education and future working environment. However, there is a
   lack of established measures to gauge this skill. The Postgraduate
   Self-determined Learning Questionnaire (PSLQ) is a newly developed
   measure to gauge postgraduate students' self-determined learning skills.
   The objective of this study was to assess the properties of this newly
   developed questionnaire. A total of 440 postgraduate students from a
   university in Malaysia have participated in this research. Data were
   gathered through online survey. In addition, nine postgraduate students
   from the same university were interviewed. These students were taken
   from both science and non-science disciplines. The results of the
   analysis showed that PSLQ can be used to measure postgraduate students'
   self-determined learning. However, some minor improvement is required.
   The instrument can be used by researchers, lecturers and university
   administrators as a tool to determine self-determined learning at the
   postgraduate level. Implications and suggestions for future
   investigations were discussed in this paper.},

Title = {Self-determined approach to learning: A social science perspective},
Journal = {COGENT EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Over recent years the higher education sector has been encouraged to
   find different, effective and flexible ways of teaching. This enthusiasm
   is apparent more than ever before, as the current British Conservative
   governmenthas produced a white paper on the Teaching Excellence
   Framework (TEF). The TEF intends to measure and improve the quality of
   teaching and learning within the higher education sector. With this
   proposed framework being introduced, universities will have to think of
   new ways of teaching and learning. This paper examines the pedagogical
   approach to self-determined learning within the dynamic of the tutor and
   the learner. In the paper, the authors argue for a fundamental rethink
   of how students learn in the higher education sector. Moreover, the
   authors call for a greater emphasis on a self-determined approach to
   learning and the integration of heutagogy, as this approach challenges
   the pedagogical approach to teaching and learning.},

Abstract = {This empirical qualitative study investigates whether the introduction
   of heutagogy in contemporary nursing education can foster the
   development of the digital self-determined learner, who is prepared to
   work and live in the fourth industrial age and beyond. The impact of
   heutagogical design on learner process and outcomes is explored through
   qualitative framework analysis of learner data and reflective educator
   observations. Findings suggest that with careful scaffolding and courage
   in remaining true to the educational philosophy, this approach has the
   potential to develop learners who demonstrate key principles of
   heutagogy including non-linear learning, learner agency, capability,
   self-reflection and metacognition and double-loop learning. This
   innovative study provides insight into the process of developing the
   self-determined learner and encourages further research into flexible
   and learner-centred approaches across Higher Education.},

Journal = {LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH},

Volume = {25},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article shows how the self-determined learning environment in
   Paths, an innovative teacher-education (TE) program, enables students to
   experience meaningful learning which reinforces their mental wellbeing
   and resilience. According to the self-determination theory (SDT), a
   central goal of such a learning environment is to support students'
   three basic emotional and social needs of self-capacity, autonomy, and
   relatedness and connections with others. While the Paths program trains
   the students to be high-school teachers, and coaches them to be mentors
   for youth at risk (YAR), about half of these students define themselves
   as having been YAR who suffered from a low level of resilience and
   mental wellbeing in their adolescence. Using the self-determined
   learning environment, Paths fosters students as self-determined learners
   in many courses which use methods like Project-Based Learning (PBL),
   Self-Determined Learning (Heutagogy), Outdoor Training (ODT), and
   Self-Management Learning (SML). In keeping with the qualitative
   multiple-case study method, semi-structured interviews with four Paths
   graduates and examples of other graduates' learning presentations
   demonstrated that graduates' learning experiences supported their
   emotional and social needs and strengthened their feelings of resilience
   and mental wellbeing during and after the learning. The graduates
   testified that this learning environment helped them to become
   entrepreneurs and empowering educators, as well as social and
   environmental activists. These findings reveal the productive
   contribution of the self-determined learning environment to students'
   development as teachers and YAR mentors, and as social and environmental
   leaders.},

Journal = {EDUCATION AND TRAINING},

Volume = {60},
Number = {7-8, SI},
Pages = {841-856},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the perceptions and
   perspectives of students with regards to self-determined learning in an
   entrepreneurship education (EE) context and its potential contribution
   to employability.
   Design/methodology/approach This research used a mixed-methods approach
   with a sample of 25 students currently attending a UK higher education
   institute. The students had access to participation in EE modules but
   self-determined learning-informed modules or programmes were not
   currently offered. Students were invited to attend focus groups and as a
   result of emergent themes, a business school-wide survey was developed.
   Findings This research makes two tentative contributions to the EE
   field. First, the findings of this student cohort are similar to those
   found throughout the UK and the EU with regard to the perception of the
   value of a degree by students; its contribution to the hidden
   curriculum; and the importance of practical experience. The research
   also adds to the field by considering the value of a self-determined
   learning approach to developing the capabilities and competencies of
   graduates. This approach to learning in a context of EE was in general
   well received by potential students, particularly the applied aspect of
   the programme. However, there is a perception of risk about this
   approach to learning and students are concerned about the value of a
   programme like this to employers in general.
   Originality/value The study contributes to discussions on the value of
   EE on perceived employability and in particular self-determined learning
   through entrepreneurship activity.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated whether online students' sense of
   community and self-determined need satisfaction predicted online course
   satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of 136
   Australian university students who were studying online during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Students completed online surveys for sense of
   community (i.e., social connectedness and learning community),
   self-determined need satisfaction (i.e., relatedness, competence, and
   autonomy), and online course satisfaction. The study results indicated
   that learning community and social connectedness significantly predicted
   the self-determined needs and online course satisfaction, with learning
   community having a large effect size. Autonomy partially mediated the
   relationship between social connectedness and online course
   satisfaction; autonomy was the only self-determined need to predict
   online course satisfaction. It was concluded that online university
   students require learning communities and social connectedness to meet
   their needs and have a satisfying learning experience. The
   self-determined need of autonomy was the most important for student's
   satisfaction with their course. These findings have implications for
   universities to build a sense of community in their courses to support
   students' needs and improve online course satisfaction.},

Abstract = {Self-determination theory proposes that the extent to which students'
   motivation is self-determined is critical to learning outcomes. Based on
   occasional research evidence and our perceptions, we hypothesize that
   college students in certain majors have profiles that are higher in
   self-determined motivation than students in other majors. Specifically,
   our primary hypothesis is that students in the social sciences and
   humanities tend to be more self-determined, whereas students in
   business-related majors tend to be less self-determined. The results
   from two studies using large samples and advanced analytical methods
   support the primary hypotheses. Comparison results were also obtained
   for other majors (e.g., engineering and natural sciences), and
   supplemental analyses supported the critical role of self-determined
   motivation in learning outcomes among students in all majors. Study 2
   also found support for two mechanisms for such differences, i.e., the
   majors' learning climates and students' individual differences in
   autonomous functioning. The current evidence suggests the importance of
   promoting more humanistic learning environments in certain academic
   disciplines.},

   studies on some objective regulations of learning theories, the authors
   concentrated on the point of how learners' internal factors affected the
   style and outcomes of learning. Then, according to the disadvantages
   that had existed in the present training system in Chinese management
   institute, the authors established self-determined learning model,
   illustrated its framework, general operation and advantages, which
   offering some new directions for further study and advice for promoting
   the reform of Chinese higher education, particularly in management.},

Abstract = {Based on Self-Determination Theory (Deci \& Ryan, 1993) two teaching
   units for German language education were developed and implemented in
   regular classes to promote self-determined motivation in high-school
   Students. The reaching units-were evaluated within a treatment-control
   group design with 20 classes of eight-grade-students. In comparison with
   the control group, the treatment group showed positive effects on
   teachers' care, students' attitude toward learning and self-determined
   motivation, and dependent on the type of school on students' perceived
   autonomy support and achievement. The most positive effects were found
   in high school (Gymnasium), whereas negative treatment effects on
   students' achievement were partially found in junior high school
   (Realschule) and secondary school (Hauptschule).},

Abstract = {Coaching is an essential component of supporting teachers to implement
   evidence-based practices (EBPs) in classrooms. The Self-Determined
   Learning Model of Instruction (SDLMI), an EBP designed to promote
   student self-determination, uses a research-based coaching model with
   six guiding principles. This qualitative study analyzed the content of
   coaching conversations between coaches and general and special education
   high school teachers implementing the SDLMI with autistic students to
   explore alignment with the guiding principles of the SDLMI coaching
   model. Findings highlighted the usefulness of the coaching principles in
   building trust between coaches and teachers, supporting teachers to set
   meaningful goals and build skills and competencies related to SDLMI
   implementation, promoting innovation and fidelity, and facilitating
   reflective dialogue. Implications for research and practice are
   discussed.},

   debates on the application of self-determined learning within a higher
   education setting. This research project used a series of qualitative

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to detect the motivational profiles of high
   school students of Physical Education (PE) according to the teacher's
   discipline strategies and to analyze the relationships between the
   clusters and the motivational atmosphere, goal guidelines and
   satisfaction with lessons. A sample of 2002 students (970 male students
   and 1032 female students) was used. The instruments used were the
   Spanish versions of the scales: Strategies to Sustain Discipline Scale,
   Learning and Performance Orientations in Physical Education Classes
   Questionnaire, Perception of Success Questionnaire and Sport
   Satisfaction Instrument. A cluster analysis was applied revealing three
   motivational profiles, one of them with emphasis on self-determined
   strategies to maintain discipline in class and the other two profiles
   with emphasis on non-self-determined-strategies. Profiles were
   determined according to the number of hours of exercise practiced in a
   week. The self-determined strategies cluster consists mainly of women,
   and the non-self-determined clusters were composed of men. In the
   self-determined strategies cluster, we can find the largest number of
   students who practice two or more hours of physical exercise per week in
   their free time. To improve the classroom environment and reduce
   indiscipline behaviors, the teacher should use discipline strategies
   founded on intrinsic reasons for concern and responsibility.},

Abstract = {In the context of education, this study examined the relationship
   between perceiving a transformational physical education (PE) teacher
   and student's leisure-time physical activity (PA). Furthermore, we
   tested the potential mediation role of motivational learning climate,
   passion and self-determined motivation in this relationship. The sample
   was composed of 2210 high-school PE students (1145 males, 1065 females)
   between 16 and 20 years of age. Results of structural equation modeling
   revealed that the perceived transformational PE teacher-PA outcomes
   relationship was stronger when students perceived a task-involving
   climate, when they were harmoniously passionate, and when they were
   self-determined. We conclude that students' health-enhancing behaviours
   could be improved if their PE teachers use transformational teaching
   style and created a task-oriented learning climate.},

Journal = {MILITARY MEDICINE},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective: To determine how many students retained their own goals
   during a 6-month radiology course and to evaluate the impact on the
   final examination scores. Methods: At the beginning of the radiology
   course in 2003, all first-year military nursing students (N = 60) were
   asked to list their self-determined goals for learning radiology. After
   the 6-month course, they were asked to restate their initial
   self-determined goals, without previous notice. The replies were
   classified into three groups, as follows: group 1, those who did not
   restate their own goals accurately; group 2, those who restated their
   own goals accurately; group 3, those who stated, 1 don't remember.{''}
   The mean examination scores for the groups were compared by using
   Student's t test. Results: The mean score (mean +/- SD, 69.6 +/- 6.9)
   for students in group 3 was significantly higher than that (mean +/- SD,
   61.8 +/- 5.8) for students in group 1 (p = 0.003). The mean score (mean
   +/- SD, 64.7 +/- 6.9) for group 2 was higher than that for group 1, but
   the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.109).
   Conclusions: Retaining self-determined goals has clear advantages in a
   military nursing school. However, those who are honest and report
   forgetting their self-determined goals do not always achieve poor
   results on the examination.},

Abstract = {Given that self-knowledge is recognized as a key component of
   self-determined behavior, intentionally teaching students with learning
   disabilities (LD) about their identified disability can create
   conditions needed for future self-determined behavior. In the following
   article, action steps are provided that are useful for fostering
   development of vital self-knowledge, self-advocacy skills, and
   self-determination. These steps toward self-determination are built on a
   foundation of self-knowledge that includes disability, and self-advocacy
   skill practice that can be implemented with elementary, middle, and high
   school students identified with LD.},

Abstract = {As an increasing number of international students are studying in
   English-speaking universities, there has been growing interest in
   exploring the factors and complexities that impact international
   students' academic achievement and adaptation during their studies. The
   present study aimed to investigate how international students adapt to
   new academic environments in US universities by exploring the
   relationships between self-determined motivation, beliefs about
   classroom assessments, the use of self-regulatory learning strategies,
   and academic performance based on self-determination theory. To examine
   international students' learning experiences, 321 international Asian
   undergraduate students at a large research-intensive midwestern
   university participated in an online survey. Structural equation
   modeling was conducted to test the proposed model. The findings
   demonstrated that self-determined motivation in courses led to adaptive
   beliefs about classroom assessments, which promoted a variety of
   self-regulatory learning strategies, including shallow and metacognitive
   strategies. Metacognitive learning strategies were significantly related
   to students' academic performance. This study allows us to better
   understand how Asian international students adapt to US academic
   environments through their motivation to learn, perspectives about
   classroom assessments, and learning strategies across different academic
   disciplines at the university level.},

Abstract = {The different motivations postulated by the Self-Determination Theory
   have proved to be meaningful to predict the level of engagement in a
   wide variety of life domains. The present research examines the relation
   between the different forms of self-determined motivation and behavioral
   automaticity of 12 behaviors associated with different life domains.
   Following 1743 measurements of self-determination (using a short version
   of the situational motivational scale, SIMS8), behavioral automaticity
   (using the self-reported behavioral automaticity index, SRBAI), and
   behavioral frequency (self-reported number of executions in a unit of
   time) for 12 various common behaviors collected on 315 young adults
   (M-age = 20.60 +/- 2.87 years) through an online survey, the results of
   crossed linear mixed models indicated that self-determined motivations
   are more associated with behavioral automaticity than
   non-self-determined motivations (intrinsic motivation: beta = 0.13, p <
   .001, identified extrinsic motivation: beta = 0.13, p < .001; external
   extrinsic motivation : beta = 0.08, p < .001; amotivation: beta = 0.02,
   p = .433). Furthermore, self-determination played a moderating role
   between the repetition of behaviors and behavioral automaticity (beta =
   0.06, p < .002) suggesting that self-determination facilitated
   automatization, as high level of behavioral automaticity was achieved
   with less frequent behaviors when behaviors were performed for highly
   self-determined (beta = 0.41, p < .001) than weakly self-determined
   reasons (beta = 0.29, p < .001). The applications of these findings for
   learning and habit formation are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study explored the motivational experiences of nine successful
   elite performers in ballet, music, and swimming at Norwegian talent
   development (TD) schools. Semistructured interviews were conducted.
   Thematic analysis revealed that the performers navigated within and
   between several contextual layers, characterized by egalitarian values,
   high-performance deliberate practice, and controlling conditions. These
   TD learning conditions provided multifaceted motivational experiences
   that affected performers' motivational regulation, ranging from
   predominantly self-determined, via multifaceted, to predominantly
   controlled. The types of motivational regulation mattered, as performers
   regulated by self-determined motivation engaged in their performance
   development in a more joyful, robust, and healthy way (i.e.,
   self-realization, flow, self-esteem, and vitality), showing less
   dependence on their given TD learning conditions. In contrast,
   performers regulated by controlled motivation reported higher
   vulnerability, and in turn, more ill-being (i.e., low self-esteem,
   perfectionism, obsessiveness, anxiety, negative affect, and exhaustion).},

Title = {The dynamic mix of heutagogy and technology: Preparing learners for
   lifelong learning},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1629-1645},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With the swift pivot to online learning, teachers and students have been
   forced to adopt a new way of teaching and learning, which has required
   students to become more self-directed in their learning. In addition,
   teachers are faced with the challenge of preparing students for the
   workforce and lifelong learning. One emerging approach for addressing
   both these challenges is that of heutagogy, or self-determined learning.
   This paper discusses the rising demand for lifelong learning skills and
   the role that heutagogy can play in supporting students in developing
   self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Specifically, the paper
   presents a case study of a higher education institution that has
   introduced heutagogy, using interviews with programme
   leaders/instructors to investigate how a college in Israel incorporated
   heutagogy into their master's education programmes. Case study results
   reveal that there are challenges in incorporating heutagogy (eg,
   difficulty for students in adopting the approach), but once adopted,
   students preferred learning in a self-determined way.
   Practitioner notes
   What is already known about this topic?
   Lifelong learning skills are critical to student employability, and
   there is a need for exploring new theories and approaches for developing
   these skills.
   The current pandemic has forced traditional learning into the online
   space, requiring more self-directed learning skills in learners.
   Heutagogy has been identified as a net-centric teaching and learning
   theory for online learning.
   What this paper adds
   Positions heutagogy for use in traditional and online classroom settings
   in order to develop learners' self-directed and lifelong learning
   skills.
   Explores the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum and its use as an
   instructional strategy.
   Presents a case study of a higher education institution that has
   implemented self-determined learning.
   Implications for practice and/or policy
   This study encourages further research into use of heutagogy for
   developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills.
   This study provides guidance for those who want to introduce
   self-determined learning into classroom settings.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Based on recommendations from a recent review of
   self-determination theory (Vallerand, R. J. (1997). In: M. Zanna (Ed.),
   Advances in experimental social psychology (pp. 271-360). New York:
   Academic Press) the present study aimed to uncover the different
   motivational profiles in physical education. It was expected that at
   least two motivational profiles would emerge: a self-determined profile
   and a controlling motivation/amotivation profile.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Method: Questionnaires were administered to 428 British students, aged
   between 14 and 16 years, from two schools in the Northwest of England.
   Results: A cluster analysis produced three motivational profiles in the
   first school, which were replicated in the second school. The first was
   named the `self-determined profile' because the students displayed high
   self-determined motivation, effort, enjoyment, and cooperative learning,
   and low controlling motivation, amotivation, boredom, and unequal
   recognition. The second profile was the `moderate motivation profile'
   with moderate scores on all variables measured. The third was named the
   `controlling motivation/amotivation' profile because the students
   demonstrated high controlling motivation, amotivation, boredom, and
   unequal recognition, and low self-determined motivation, effort, and
   enjoyment.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate the importance of developing
   self-determination in physical education, as it is associated with
   desirable behavioural and affective outcomes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Psychological factors contribute to motivation and learning for
   international students as much as teaching strategies. 254 international
   students and 144 local students enrolled in a private education
   institute were surveyed regarding their perception of psychological
   needs support, their motivation and learning approach. The results from
   this study indicated that international students had a higher level of
   self-determined motivation and used a deep and surface learning approach
   more extensively than local students. Perceived psychological needs
   support positively predicted intrinsic motivation, identified regulation
   and a deep learning approach for both groups. There were also
   differences in the effects of motivation on learning approach between
   the two groups. Further possibilities for exploration are discussed in
   this study.},

Abstract = {The study faces two objectives: (a) to examine the construct validity of
   the 3x2 Classroom Goal Structures Questionnaire, and (b) to jointly
   analyze the influence of the classroom goal structures and 3x2
   achievement goals on high school students' self-determined motivation.
   2284 students participated (51.6\% men and 48.4\% women) aged 12-17
   years (M = 14.31 years, SD = 1.15), from 148 classrooms. The results of
   confirmatory factor analysis supported the hypothesized model. The
   validity and internal consistency of the questionnaire were
   satisfactory. The results of hierarchical linear models provided support
   to the direct, indirect and interaction models. Regarding direct
   effects, self-approach structure, and self-approach and task-approach
   goals were positive predictors of self-determined motivation, whereas
   the other-approach structure, and other-approach and task-avoidance
   goals were negative predictors. In relation to indirect effects, the
   results revealed that the three approach goals, and task-avoidance goals
   were partial mediators of the relationship between the self-approach
   structure and self-determined motivation, whereas other-approach goals
   were partial mediators in the relationship with their parallel
   structure. Regarding the interaction effects, the relationship between
   task-approach goals and self-determination varied depending on the
   other-approach structure.},

Title = {Blended learning in radiology: Is self-determined learning really more
   effective?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {78},
Number = {3},
Pages = {384-387},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective To investigate whether there are differences in learning
   outcomes after the application of self-determined (intrinsic motivation)
   or mandatory (extrinsic motivation) use of e-learning units in an
   undergraduate radiology internship.
   Methods 96 medical students undergoing a one-week radiology internship
   were included in this study. Ten electronic cases (e-cases) were created
   for a blended learning approach. The e-learning environment was accessed
   on a self-determined (group B; n = 32) or a mandatory basis (group C; n
   = 32). A group without access to the e-learning environment served as
   control group (group A; n = 32). Usage parameters of the e-cases were
   recorded. Results of a pre-and post-course assessment were used to
   quantitatively analyze learning outcomes.
   Results In group B 19/32 (59\%) students processed at least one e-case,
   while in group C all students processed at least one e-case. There was a
   trend towards a higher improvement in knowledge in students exposed to a
   blended learning approach (group B: 13.7\%; group C: 15.4\%) than in the
   control group (group A: 8.5\%; p = 0.5356). Group C processed (p =
   0.0093) and passed (p = 0.0078) significantly more e-cases, than with
   group B. There were no significant differences in the mean time per
   e-case and the total time on e-cases between both groups.
   Conclusion Extrinsic motivation results in a more extensive use of
   e-learning units in an undergraduate radiology internship when compared
   with intrinsic motivation. The choice of the teaching strategy has a
   bigger influence on learning outcomes than the type of motivation,
   highlighting the need for qualified medical teachers. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   synthesize an empirical literature review of the M-Heutagogical practice
   among Higher Education students and its acceptance. The main objective
   of this paper is to review the literature on M-Heutagogy practice and
   its acceptance among Higher Education students. The researcher conducted
   a systematic review of 60 articles for the period 2007 to 2020. The
   findings indicate that M-Heutagogy has been applied in HEIs around the
   world with the support of emergent technologies and mobile applications.
   Unfortunately, only two M-Heutagogy acceptance studies have been done so
   far. Future research suggested that the M-Heutagogy acceptance model

Abstract = {Preparing students for the complex and changing nature of the workforce
   has become an overriding objective within higher education. New
   pedagogies, which incorporate both informal and formal learning and
   support personalization of learning, are central to this objective.
   Educators are required to reassess the use of traditional pedagogies, as
   they attempt to foster development of skills and competencies for
   lifelong learning. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is a learning
   theory that addresses this need, giving students agency in determining
   what and how they learn. The theory is based in the principles of
   learner agency, capability and self-efficacy, reflection and
   metacognition, and non-linear learning, and when used with technology
   can be a powerful instructional approach for building students'
   self-directed and lifelong learning skills. A compelling example of this
   is the e-portfolio. As a platform and assessment tool, the e-portfolio
   spans the spectrum of lifelong learning, as well as encompasses both
   formal and informal learning of the individual learner and addresses
   critical aspects of learning and reflection, showcasing the learner's
   acquired skills and competencies. Based on successful cases in the
   literature, this article discusses the principles of heutagogy, the
   pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH continuum) and its application in
   online learning environments, and the use of the eportfolio in further
   cultivating and advancing self-determined learning. The article also
   offers recommendations for future practice and theory.},

Abstract = {People with disabilities consistently advocate for their right to be

   impacts of differing intensities of teacher implementation supports
   (online modules only vs. online modules + coaching) on the initiation of
   the self-determined learning model of instruction (SDLMI) by schools and
   teachers and outcomes for students that arise from more intensive
   implementation when schools and teachers do initiate. Results suggested
   that intensifying teacher implementation supports has a positive impact

Abstract = {Education 4.0 emphasizes the use of hybrid approaches in the learning
   process. The use of peeragogy, heutagogy, and cybergogy may engage
   students in the learning processes in which active learning plays a key
   role. This study aimed to examine the effect of the implementation of
   the Merdeka Curriculum on active learning practices and their
   relationships with hybrid activities based on hybrid learning
   approaches, and active learning counterparts of (1) self-regulated
   learning: (2) self-directed learning, and (3) self-determined learning.
   These relationships will be examined in Indonesian curriculum
   implementation in which student-centered principles are emphasized. A
   cross-sectional survey was conducted by collecting responses of
   vocational high school students on survey. The digital questionnaire was
   sent to 600 Indonesian students, of whom 555 completed it. The
   relationships among the constructs were examined using a structural
   equation modeling. The results showed that a curriculum emphasizing
   student-centered principles was fully mediated by active learning and
   hybrid activities to promote student self-regulated learning (SRL),
   self-determined learning (SDET), and self-directed learning (SDL).
   Active learning and hybrid activities directly affect students' SRL,
   SDET, and SDL, Three counterparts of active learning that form important
   parts of long-life learning. This model indicates that Indonesian
   curriculum implementation may encourage active learning and indirectly
   increase learner engagement, autonomy, and metacognitive development.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to analyze the relationships between
   motivational profiles in a sample of 819 adolescent physical education
   students and the time spent on doing sport and physical activity outside
   school hours. The Learning and Performance Orientation in Physical
   Education Questionnaire (LAPOPEQ), the Sport Motivation Scale (SMS) and
   the Importance of Physical Education scale (IPE) as perceived by pupils
   were completed. The cluster analysis showed three motivational profiles:
   the ``self-determined profile{''}, formed by subjects who perceived a
   climate that placed more emphasis on the importance of effort, personal
   improvement and the development of skills (task climate) and high
   intrinsic motivation; the ``non self-determined profile{''}, formed by
   subjects with moderate amotivation and who perceived a climate that gave
   priority to the demonstration of personal capacity and performance (ego
   climate), and, finally, the ``low-motivated profile{''}, formed by
   people who obtain the lowest values (intrinsic motivation, extrinsic
   motivation, motivational climate and importance and usefulness attached
   to physical education). The students that do more exercise and spend the
   most time on exercising were associated with the self-determined
   profile. These results can help to establish intervention programs to
   try to reduce the sport drop-out rate in adolescents.},

Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-13},
Abstract = {Higher education has been actively encouraged to find more effective and
   flexible delivery models to provide all students with access to quality
   learning experiences yet also meet institutional imperatives for
   efficiency and accountability. Blended learning, commonly defined as an
   integration of traditional face-to-face and online approaches to
   instruction ( Garrison \& Kanuka, 2004; Graham, 2006; Macdonald, 2008),
   is now proposed as one solution that addresses both student learning and
   higher education organisational needs. Successful blended learning,
   however, is more than a simple integration of information and
   communication technologies with face-to-face approaches. This paper
   proposes, describes and evaluates a pedagogical approach to blended
   learning focused on learners and learning. First, we interrogate the
   literature related to blended learning to show how various constructions
   of blended learning may be driven by teacher-centric or learner-centric
   conceptions. Next, planning a learner-centric blended learning design
   for a core unit in a first year higher education course is described.
   The design is then evaluated using a mixed methodology in which the
   students' voices illuminate their experiences of blended learning unit
   design with regards to engagement, learning and self-determination.},

Abstract = {Self-determination theory (SDT) is outlined and used as a basis for
   discussing the facilitation of education and adjustment of individuals
   with mental retardation (MR). The theory differentiates intrinsic and
   extrinsic motivation with respect to the concept of self-determination.
   The innate psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness
   are used as a basis for specifying how ongoing social contexts as well
   as intervention programs will affect self-determined motivation and, in
   turn, learning, adjustment, and life circumstances. Laboratory
   experiments and field studies are reviewed indicating that: (1) social
   contexts that facilitate satisfaction of the three basic needs-by
   providing optimal challenge, informational feedback, interpersonal
   involvement, and autonomy support-promote both intrinsic motivation and
   self-determined forms of extrinsic motivation; and (2) intrinsic
   motivation and self-determined extrinsic motivation are positively
   associated with high-quality learning and personal adjustment. Although
   most of the SDT research has been done with normal samples, the
   relevance of this work for the field of MR is readily apparent. Further,
   some specific work in the field of MR is discussed as it relates to SDT.},

Abstract = {Vocational Education Training (VET)in China is considered the last
   resort for low academic achievers or economically desperate students who
   wish to join the job market after a short educational period. In
   addition, a large volume of evidence has claimed that China's government
   is putting a blindfold on VET outcomes, which results in incompetent
   graduates who do not fit in with the current industrial workforce need.
   Hence, a selfdetermination theory furnished this study to underpin the
   effectiveness of the training and derive plans or strategies which
   foster the training program. Thus, the present study administered a
   national survey of (N = 5083) to vocational students to examine their
   self-determined learning motivation by determining the specific times,
   places, and individuals who need a feasible intervention to engage in
   VET work and help make the country's industrial production competent at
   the world market level. Hence, our study findings shed light on
   vocational students in China who lose their learning motivation over
   time; those with other alternatives drop out of the program. Those who
   are desperate continue without an adequate practical skill level, given
   that they have to get a job to help their poor parents.},

   adaptations of instruments: Sport Satisfaction Instrument, Sport
   Motivation Scale and Learning and Performance Orientations in PE Classes
   Questionnaire. We conducted a descriptive statistical analysis and
   correlations with structural equation modeling. The results showed the
   highest mean values in satisfaction / fun, intrinsic motivation and
   motivational task-oriented climate. By using a structural equation
   model, we found a positive association between a task-oriented climate
   and students' intrinsic motivation (gamma=.69) and their satisfaction in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {61},
Number = {2},
Pages = {144-154},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {BackgroundSelf-determined behaviour is composed of multiple,
   interrelated component elements, and yet little empirical study has
   researched the self-determination components other than choice making
   and goal setting. Also, few theoretical relationships have been drawn
   between the component elements of self-determined behaviour and the
   impact of disability category. Therefore, this study examined profiles
   of the combination of three self-report measures of component elements
   of self-determined behaviour (autonomous functioning, problem solving
   and internal locus of control) between two groups (ID and learning
   disabilities/emotional disorders).
   MethodWe analysed data from 96 middle school and high school students
   ages 13 through 22years who completed three self-report instruments of
   the Autonomy - section 1 of The Arc's Self-determination Scale, the
   Problem Solving Survey and the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control
   Scale. A multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted to
   investigate the differences between the two groups after controlling for
   the developmental effects of age. A discriminant function analysis
   examined whether membership of the two groups could be predicted from
   the three component elements.
   ResultsResults showed that each group had different profiles within the
   combined three component elements of self-determination but groups were
   not different on any single measure of component elements of
   self-determined behaviour exclusively. The combination of three
   variables was useful in confirming the membership of two dichotomous
   groups.
   ConclusionsScore differences on the three component behaviour imply that
   the two groups have different instructional needs and therefore require
   differentiated instructional approaches. The three measures of the
   component elements of self-determined behaviour collectively separate
   the two groups, suggesting that the component elements should be
   considered in a combination as opposed to being treated as individual
   elements in the context of discussing self-determined behaviour.},

Abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) technology can promote sustainable consumption and

   psychological mechanisms that promote sustainable purchase intention
   from the perspective of VR education. Based on the self-determined
   motivation theory and VR attributes, this study proposes and empirically
   examines the underlying mechanism of VR customer knowledge education on
   sustainable purchase intention. The results show that VR customer
   knowledge education has a positive effect on customers' sustainable
   product knowledge levels, and subsequently, on sustainable purchase
   intention through the two mediators of knowledge richness and
   usefulness. Additionally, customers' intrinsic (versus extrinsic)
   learning motivation leads to a higher sustainable knowledge enhancement
   effect. Nonetheless, this effect is moderated by customers' prior
   sustainable knowledge; customers with low (versus high) prior
   sustainable knowledge are more susceptible to the effects of VR customer
   knowledge education.},

Abstract = {To diminish the digital divide in remote areas, the Ministry of
   Education in Taiwan initiates the I-Taiwan Projects, providing a digital
   tutoring program with the platform for synchronously teaching and
   learning. The program recruited and trained college and university
   students for online teaching of elementary and junior high school
   students living in remote towns and villages. Despite the great efforts
   devoted to recruiting and training, college students for online tutoring
   still have the difficulties in retention and persistence in the program.
   This research attempts to examine the factors influencing continuous
   intention towards using E-tutoring system, particularly focus on the
   roles of self-determined motivators, as well as social and technological
   influences. The extended Technology Accepted Model (TAM) was integrated
   with self-determination theory of motivation and social influences to
   develop the research model. Using a field survey of 119 college students
   participated in the Digital Tutoring Program, the results empirically
   validates the hypothesized relationships, indicating that enjoyment
   (intrinsic motivator) and social presence (social influence factor) were
   found to be the most important determinants of e-tutors' continuous
   intention towards using e-tutoring system. The results show that
   self-determined motivators and social influence factor were useful for
   predicting continuance intention of e-tutoring system. Findings may
   provide some practical implications for setting expectations for college
   students' online tutorials, and the needs for e-tutoring system
   development.},

   attainment and on access to the general education curriculum for
   students with intellectual disability and learning disabilities.
   Findings support the efficacy of the model for both goal attainment and
   access to the general education curriculum, though students varied in
   the patterns of goal attainment as a function of type of disability.},

   overview of heutagogy, highlighting the potential advantages for

   aim of the present study was to offer insight into student-coaches'
   experiences on a sports coaching bachelor degree module that was
   underpinned by a heutagogical approach to learning. Twenty-six
   student-coaches (6 females and 20 males) took part in semi-structured
   group interviews, 19 of whom had completed an end of module survey. Data
   were analyzed inductively and findings revealed that performance on, and
   perceptions of, the module showed the approach was differentially
   effective, with three higher order themes representing the
   student-coaches' articulation of their experiences: (a) attitudinal
   disposition, (b) knowledge and experience, and (c) skill set. Although
   the findings of present study suggest heutagogy is a potentially useful
   method in coach education, we also highlight some potentially essential
   caveats to the use of the method.},

Abstract = {In this cross-sectional study, we tested the associations between
   teacher autonomy support, self-determined motivation for physical
   education (PE), physical activity habits and non-participation in
   physical education in a sample of adolescents. A total of 715
   adolescents (of whom 371 (51.89\%) were girls) participated. The ages
   ranged from 14 to 18 years, with mean ages of 16.00 (SD = 0.79) for
   girls and 15.99 (SD = 0.75) for boys. The study questionnaire consisted
   of demographic questions and the Learning Climate Questionnaire, Revised
   Perceived Locus of Causality in Physical Education Questionnaire,
   Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire 2, Self-Report Habit
   Index for Physical Activity, Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire,
   Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, perceived physical fitness and frequency of
   non-participation in PE classes. The results showed that perceived
   teacher autonomy support was directly positively associated with
   physical activity habits and negatively with non-participation in
   physical education classes. Autonomous motivation for PE was a mediator
   between perceived teacher autonomy support and physical activity habits,
   meaning that higher autonomous motivation was related to higher physical
   activity habits. Motivation for PE was also a mediator between teacher
   autonomy support and non-participation in PE. Higher autonomous
   motivation for PE was associated with less frequent non-participation in
   PE classes. The findings can inform PE teachers' practice by showing
   that supporting students' autonomy and strengthening their
   self-determined motivation can facilitate increased participation in PE
   classes and the formation of students' physical activity habits.},

Abstract = {Pedagogical foundations exist for incorporating technology in

   Technologies (ICTs), students now can share content directed at external
   audiences, i.e., audiences other than the instructor. These audiences
   are referred to as authentic audiences as they are public-facing and
   exist outside of the classroom. The existing literature offers evidence
   of student satisfaction with assignments directed at appealing to
   external audiences, however, the literature provides no comprehensive
   pedagogical rationale for assignments directed at authentic audiences
   wherein the goals are self-determined. The authors discuss the theory of
   heutagogy, the study of self-determined learning, as an approach for
   assessing assignments that utilize ICTs and are directed at authentic
   audiences. Finally, the authors offer an approach for the assessment of
   these assignments, including a rubric.},

Abstract = {All students go through a variety of transitions throughout their life
   (i.e., middle school to high school, high school to the workforce).
   However, students with disabilities tend to experience disparities
   compared to their peers without disabilities in regard to in-school and
   postschool outcomes. One way to enhance outcomes for students with
   disabilities is providing opportunities for students to enhance their
   self-determination. One evidence-based practice to enhance
   self-determination is the Self-Determined Learning Model of Instruction
   (SDLMI). To support self-determination in transition planning, teachers
   can use the SDLMI to enable students to direct their own learning and
   work towards self-selected transition goals related to enhanced
   in-school and postschool outcomes, such as goal attainment, competitive
   integrated employment, and community participation. This article
   describes how teachers can support students in setting and working
   towards goals while also supporting progress in their IEP to enhance
   student voice and student-directed transition planning},

   Parents and teachers diverged in their evaluations of the
   self-determination capacities of youth but agreed that opportunities to
   engage in self-determined behavior were available both at school and
   home. Although social skill and problem behavior ratings both were
   significant predictors of teachers' ratings of students'
   self-determination capacity, opportunities at school, opportunities at
   home, and problem behaviors were negatively correlated with ratings of

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to test a model of motivation based on
   self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan, 2002) and which explores the
   place of `teacher-student' negotiation. Cross-sectional data were
   gathered from 549 secondary school students (317 male, 232 female) who
   answered a questionnaire which included measurements of perceived
   negotiation, of the satisfaction of needs, of motivation, of perceived
   enjoyment, of the perception of having learned, of the intention to
   practise a physical sporting activity outside school. Structural
   equation analysis has shown that the students who perceived integrative
   negotiation experienced higher levels of autonomy and relatedness.
   Autonomy and competence determined self-determined motivation, which in
   turn positively predicted consequences. The results support
   self-determination theory and support its application in the context of

Title = {Social Support by Teacher and Motivational Profile of Higher Education
   Students},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY SOCIETY \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-25},
Abstract = {Currently, educational trends show how cognitive and
   affective-motivational integration are presented as key factors in the
   students? learning process. Therefore, the social support that students
   receive from teachers can play an important role in motivation towards
   learning, developing intrinsic motivations which favor their commitment.
   This study presents the validation of a measuring instrument into
   Spanish context about how the university students perceive the teacher
   social support and how it relates to motivational profiles. The sample
   had 396 university students (305 men and 91 women), 22.87 years average
   age, to whom social support and academic motivation were measured. After
   the analyses, The Interpersonal Behavior Scale showed adequate
   psychometric measures. Three motivational profiles were found. The data
   showed that students with a high self-determined profile present higher
   values in social support than those with a less self-determined profile.
   It is expected these results support the evidence to train motivating
   teachers related to a positive impact on the students? learning process.

Abstract = {Introduction. Physical Education (PE) is a way of promoting sports in
   adolescents, and teachers can encourage this sport adherence by
   generating motivation in students through their teaching intervention.
   The aim of the study was to develop and implement teaching intervention
   strategies to generate an optimal motivational climate and assess their
   impact on different variables that affect students' situational
   motivation in Physical Education classes. The Achievement Goal Theory
   and the Self-determination Theory were taken as reference.
   Method. The intervention was based on the TARGET areas, developing an
   orientational teaching unit with the participation of 113 3rd year ESO
   (secondary education) students (58 boys and 53 girls; M age = 14.83 and
   SD=0.72), who were divided into an experimental group (n=46) and a
   control group (n=67). Different instruments were used to measure
   perceived motivational climate, basic psychological needs,
   self-determined situational motivation and affective consequences
   (satisfaction-enjoyment and boredom).
   Results. The results showed that the experimental group obtained
   significantly higher values with respect to the control group in the
   mastery motivational climate, as well as in autonomy, perceived
   competence, identified regulation and satisfaction-enjoyment. The
   amotivation values were significantly lower in the experimental group.
   Discussion. The results highlight the importance of the PE teacher
   transmitting task motivational climates to optimise different variables
   that affect motivation in PE classes, thus improving the
   teaching-learning process
   Conclusion. We highlight that the TARGET areas are effective to optimise
   the teaching intervention in the orientational content and to help
   improve the students' motivation in PE.},

Abstract = {Many recent studies have reported that physical activity levels decrease
   during adolescence, being more pronounced among females. Therefore,
   based on the self-determination theory (Ryan \& Deci, 2007), the aim of
   the current study was to analyze the influence of gender on motivational
   variables and cognitive and affective consequences along different
   Physical Education didactic units. In this study, 66 students (30 males
   and 36 females), aged from 15 to 17 years, (M age = 15.29, SD = 0.71),
   were involved. At the end of the three didactic units different
   situational motivational variables were measured: basic psychological
   needs by BPNES, self-determined motivation through the EMSI, affective
   consequences like enjoyment and boredom using the SSI-EF and
   predisposition toward the practice of content by PEPS. The results show
   that girls have a lower perceived competence than boys in soccer
   (p<.001). However, girls perceive a higher self-determined motivation,
   enjoyment and a greater cognitive attitude towards acrosport (p<.001).
   The intra-group analysis shows higher values in soccer content compared
   to the contents of acrosport in boys (p<.05). On the contrary, girls
   perceived motivational variables related to acrosport in a positive way
   compared to the other two contents related to cooperation-opposition
   sports (p<.05). Therefore, guidelines are proposed to reorient the
   teaching-learning process in these didactic units, by developing and
   implementing specific strategies to influence motivational processes
   based on gender.},

Abstract = {The relationship between university students' motivation and their
   learning environment is the focus of this article. Following
   self-determination theory (SDT) and the theory of interest, it is
   proposed that perceived support of basic psychological needs (support of
   autonomy, competence and social relatedness), as well as aspects of a
   constructivist learning environment (teachers' interest, relevance of
   contents, and quality of instruction, as well as transparency and fit of
   requirements) are associated with self-determined motivation and with
   study interest. The responses of a sample of undergraduate students in
   psychology (N = 123) to measures of these variables were analysed. The
   students were asked about their motivation to learn, their interest in
   psychology and about the perceived learning environment in psychology.
   The results showed that most of the students were motivated on an
   intrinsic and identified level, and displayed high study interest. Study
   interest, intrinsic motivation and self-determined forms of extrinsic
   motivation were particularly associated with perceived support of
   autonomy and competence, as well as with the relevance of the contents,
   the quality of instruction and with the perceived transparency of
   requirements.},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that motivation, epistemic beliefs, and
   perceived social support each have an effect on the way students engage
   in their learning and can promote a deep approach. The first aim of this
   study was to measure and compare these effects. Some authors have argued
   that epistemic beliefs and perceived social support do not have a direct
   effect on approach to learning, but that this effect is mediated by
   motivation. The second aim of this study was to examine this hypothesis
   and, more specifically, to determine the extent to which the effects of
   evaluativist epistemic beliefs and perceived social support promote a
   deep approach to learning directly or indirectly through self-determined
   and controlled motivation. We adopted a cross-sectional study design and
   focused on the first year of university. This study is based on the
   responses of 2168 French first year university students to a
   questionnaire. Linear regression shows that the strongest factor
   predicting a deep approach to learning is self-determined motivation,
   followed by evaluativism, and that the weakest factor is perceived
   social support, which is nevertheless a significant factor. Controlled
   motivation was found to have a weak negative effect. Mediation analyses,
   with self-determined motivation as a mediator, show the existence of
   both direct and indirect significant effects of evaluativism and
   perceived social support on deep approach to learning. These findings
   have important educational implications in that they help to identify
   key levers that teachers can activate to engage their students in deeper
   learning.},

Abstract = {Previous research reported differences in student self-determination
   based on disability status. Specifically, students without disabilities
   consistently self-report higher self-determination compared with their
   peers with disabilities, suggesting differential opportunities and
   supports for self-determination exist within school contexts. To further
   examine potential differences in student self-determination, the present
   study examined the impact of an evidence-based practice designed to
   promote student self-determination, the Self-Determined Learning Model
   of Instruction (SDLMI), on student self-determination outcomes when
   implemented in inclusive, secondary core content classrooms as a
   universal (i.e., Tier 1) support across an academic year. Findings
   suggested a relatively small change in overall self-determination during
   the first year of a multiyear study, but consistent patterns across
   students with and without disabilities. Implications for research and
   practice are discussed.},

Title = {The outcome of constructive alignment between open educational services
   and learners' needs, employability and capabilities development:
   Heutagogy and transformative migration among underprivileged learners in
   Rwanda},
Journal = {COGENT EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {While teachers play an important role in education and supporting
   learning, many learners in under-resourced settings are not privileged
   to have access to teachers. Some of these underprivileged learners deal
   with the issue by engaging in self-determined and self-directed
   learning. Their efforts sometimes pay off with access to formal higher
   education and financial resources they would not access otherwise. This
   paper reports and discusses data from interviews with two secondary
   education graduates who hunted and learned on their own notes from the
   field of Math-Physique (Mathematics and Physics), took national exams as
   non-formal learners and won government sponsorship and student loans
   that are highly competitive in Rwanda. The informants subsequently
   completed their undergraduate education in Physics and Applied
   Mathematics, respectively. One of them was completing his master's
   degree course in Applied Mathematics at the time of the interview. The
   data revealed decision-making, dedication and perseverance as key
   attributes of these learners. The informants adopted different
   strategies vis-a-vis challenges they encountered when they were learning
   on their own, and none of them surrendered. This study may benefit
   underprivileged learners as well as educators and institutions that are
   interested in opening up higher education in under-resourced settings.},

Abstract = {The use of project work (PW) or project-based learning has escalated in
   Singapore since its inception by the Ministry of Education in the year
   2000. There is however little information on students' motivation, and
   their experience of PW over time. This study sought to identify
   homogeneous groups of students with distinct perceived locus of
   causality (PLOC) profiles using a cluster analytic approach, and to
   examine group differences in their perceived psychological needs,
   emotions, metacognition. and perceived skills learned in PW over time.
   Four distinct clusters of students were identified. The ``high
   self-determined/low controlled{''} group was the most adaptive cluster,
   and the ``low self-determined/high controlled{''} group was the least
   adaptive cluster. The study affirms that the self-determination theory
   (SDT) can provide important insights into the motivational processes in
   PW. It establishes that students' motivational regulations and their
   perceived needs satisfaction at the start of PW are related to their
   experience of and learning in PW. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Concerns about body image might prevent adolescents from participating
   in physical education (PE) classes and physical activities during
   leisure-time. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the
   relationships between teacher support of autonomy, student motivations
   for PE, and positive body image, in a sample of Lithuanian adolescents.
   A total of 715 adolescents (51.89\% girls) participated in the study.
   Ages ranged from 14 to 18 years, with a mean age of 16.00 (SD = 0.79)
   for girls and 15.99 (SD = 0.75) for boys. The questionnaire consisted of
   demographic questions, the Learning Climate Questionnaire, the Revised
   Perceived Locus of Causality in Physical Education Questionnaire, the
   Body Appreciation Scale-2, the Self-Report Habit Index for Physical
   Activity (PA), perceived physical fitness (PPF), and Godin Leisure-Time
   Exercise Questionnaire. The results showed that teacher support for
   students' autonomy was associated with higher positive body image. In
   adolescent girls, autonomous motivation for PE was the mediator between
   teacher support of autonomy and positive body image. The associations
   between self-determined motivation in PE and positive body image were
   mediated by PPF on one hand, and through PA habits and PPF on the other
   hand of the structural equation model (in girls). PA habits moderated
   associations between PE motivation and PPF. Associations between PE
   motivation and PPF were stronger in girls with the lowest PA habits
   compared to girls with mean PA habits. These results suggest that PE
   classes are important for promoting students' positive body images. PE
   teachers are advised to use pedagogical strategies that promote the
   self-determined motivation of students for PE. Increased self-determined
   motivation for physical education might be an effective strategy for
   physical self-perception and positive body image promotion in adolescent
   girls, especially those with low PA habits.},

Title = {A cross-classified path analysis of the self-determination theory model
   on the situational, individual and classroom levels in college education},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {61},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {According to self-determination theory (SDT), the extent to which
   students' motivation is self-determined is critical for academic
   performance. SDT also proposes that self-determined academic motivation
   is facilitated when the learning environment supports the basic
   psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence. This
   model of social support (sic) needs satisfaction (sic) motivation (sic)
   learning outcomes is termed the general SDT model. Current evidence
   regarding this general SDT model is limited, in that, to date, no study
   has examined it in full using within-individual methods, which are
   critical for understanding inner psychological processes and mechanisms.
   Using a large and comprehensive college student dataset (total N of
   responses = 30,765), the current study aims to apply a within-individual
   analytical approach to the general SDT model. Specifically, we apply a
   cross-classified path model to account for both the between-student
   level and between-classroom level nesting structure. This model enables
   us to explain the relationships between the variables in the general SDT
   model on three levels: situational (within-student and
   within-classroom), between-student, and between-classroom.
   The results generally support the predictions on all three levels. For a
   student, a classroom, or a student's specific experience within a
   classroom, the general SDT model received support. Most importantly,
   when the same student in the same classroom experiences higher levels of
   autonomy support, she or he is more likely to have her or his
   psychological needs satisfied and to study for self-determined reasons,
   which are associated with higher perceived learning performance. Various
   unexpected results, such as the direct effects of learning climate and
   the predominance of the competence need, are also reported. Overall, the
   current research provides a comprehensive and multilevel understanding
   of the role of self-determination in college classrooms.},

Title = {Master your practice! A quantitative analysis of Device and system
   handling training to enable competent interactions with intelligent
   voice assistants},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR REPORTS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Intelligent voice assistants (IVAs), such as Siri or Alexa, are
   voice-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems that help users solve
   everyday tasks using voice commands. Users often have a superficial
   understanding of the full range of functions IVAs can be used for and
   how to use them effectively. Since higher knowledge of device and system
   handling is fundamental for positive interaction quality and
   self-determined use of IVAs, this study examines how training can
   contribute to the promotion of variables such as usage aspects, social
   perception, and self-determined interaction and how such training can be
   designed. Based on an established competence framework and the
   principles of learning psychology and media didactics, three online
   training modules were developed to strengthen the user's device and
   system handling competence, and their effects on the parameters of
   competent AI interaction were investigated. A total of 110 students took
   part in the three training studies. Results of dependent t-tests show
   that completing training modules improves device and system handling and
   increases the intention to use IVAs more self-determined. In detail,
   participants perceive IVAs as more useful, tend to be more explorative
   and indulgent, feel more competent to use IVAs, and perceive them as
   less disturbing. Overall, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of
   training in improving the perceived usefulness of IVAs, exploratory and

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a volleyball
   teaching unit program of Physical Education over situational
   motivational variables, with two levels of intervention. A first level
   by applying general strategies based on TARGET areas (Ames, 1992), and a
   second level of intervention methodically based on the Teaching Games
   for Understanding (Bunker and Thorpe, 1982) approach. The effect of the
   intervention on different situational motivational variables was
   evaluated. 61 students of the 4th year of Secondary Education were
   involved in a complete teaching unit. In the experimental group (n = 41)
   a specific intervention was applied, while in the control group (n = 20)
   there was no manipulation with a more traditional approach to teaching.
   The instruments measured the motivational climate, autonomy support,
   basic psychological needs and self-determined motivation. Results showed
   that experimental group developed a higher perceived task climate,
   greater autonomy, greater autonomy satisfaction and lower amotivation
   than the control group. Results also showed that student-centered
   approaches to teaching through game-based methodology generate optimal
   motivational climates which can impact positively on PE classes.},

Title = {Heutagogy as an alternative in teacher education: conceptions of
   lecturers and pre-service teachers of school of education and life-long
   learning, SDD-UBIDS},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Introduction The needs of today's higher education have changed and
   higher education does not need a one-way communication from teacher to
   student but rather learn to appreciate the new role of the teacher as a
   facilitator with mutual responsibilities toward the creation of
   knowledge. Heutagogy, which emphasizes learner autonomy and the creation
   of self-determined learners, has garnered attention as a potential
   solution to address the evolving needs of teacher preparation. However,
   empirical research on the beliefs and attitudes of Heutagogy within the
   teacher education context remains limited. This study aimed to fill this
   gap by exploring the beliefs and attitudes of lecturers and pre-service
   teachers of the School of Education and Life-Long Learning (SoELL) at
   SDD-UBIDS.Methods Convergent mixed method design with both quantitative
   and qualitative data analysis, the study collected both quantitative and
   qualitative data on 513 Pre-service teachers and 30 Lecturers from
   SoELL, SDD-UBIDS using a four-point Likert scale questionnaire and
   interview.Results The findings revealed diverse perspectives among
   Lecturers and Pre-service Teachers regarding Heutagogy, with varying
   levels of understanding, acceptance, and readiness for implementation.
   Lecturers expressed enthusiasm for Heutagogy's potential to foster
   learner autonomy and critical thinking skills, while pre-service
   teachers demonstrated varying levels of readiness and comfort with
   self-directed learning approaches.Discussion Lecturers and Pre-service
   teachers expressed willingness to embrace a self-determined approach in
   which the learner reflects on what is learned and how it is learned and
   where the Lecturers teach the learners how to learn by themselves. The
   cognitive conflict and the inadequacy of pre-service teachers'
   preparedness will necessitate a shift in their attitudes toward
   developing autonomy skills to effectively navigate the challenges of the
   21st-century knowledge economy.},

Title = {Enhancing Secondary Students' Goal Attainment and Self-Determination in
   General Education Mathematics Classes Using the Self-Determined Learning
   Model of Instruction},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {155-167},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives Almost every state includes content standards that are
   closely related to skills associated with self-determination (e.g.,
   decision making, planning, problem solving, goal setting and
   attainment). Additionally, research in both general and special
   education has demonstrated a close relationship between the promotion of
   self-determination and positive school (e.g., academic goal attainment)
   and post-school (e.g., employment) outcomes. Therefore, this study
   examines implementation of an evidence-based intervention to promote
   self-determination in inclusive, general education classrooms.
   Methods This study utilized multilevel linear modeling to examine
   changes in student self-determination in secondary mathematics classes
   after a year of exposure to The Self-Determined Learning Model of
   Instruction (SDLMI). Participants included were 81 students ranging from
   10th to 12th grade learning in secondary mathematics classes (Algebra
   II, Pre-Calculus, and Advanced Placement Calculus).
   Results The findings demonstrated a small, positive effect on student
   self-determination and that goal attainment during the first semester
   predicted second semester goal attainment. Specifically, the inclusion
   of goal attainment as a predictor explained 10\% of the variability in
   self-determination observed, corresponding to a small effect. Overall,
   students who attained at higher level of goal attainment had higher
   self-determination at the conclusion of the study and were expected to
   grow in their self-determination at a higher rate than those with lower
   levels of goal attainment.
   Conclusion The results from this study suggest that implementing the
   SDLMI to support all students in secondary mathematics classes
   positively impacts student attainment of skills that impact
   self-determination and has the potential to impact mathematical learning
   in future research.},

Title = {A self-determined perspective of the Sport Education Model},
Journal = {PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: The relationship between outcomes, such as student learning,
   student motivation, and continued participation in activity, remains an
   important research focus within physical education. In particular,
   research has shown that secondary students exhibit behaviors indicative
   of low levels of motivation. Thus, there is a need for teachers of high
   school physical education to provide students with motivationally
   supportive educational experiences. A model of instruction which has
   grown in popularity over the past few decades and seems to provide
   motivational support is the Sport Education Model (SEM). Previous
   studies have identified a variety of motivational benefits of the SEM,
   yet none to date have investigated the richness of student and teacher
   experiences using qualitative measures. Motivation within this study is
   grounded in self-determination theory which posits that the environment
   should be supportive of key psychological needs of autonomy, competence
   and relatedness.
   Purpose: In order to assess motivation among secondary students within
   physical education this paper offers a qualitative examination of
   student and teacher perceptions and experiences within two consecutive
   seasons of the SEM through the perspective of self-determination theory.
   Participants and setting: A heterogeneous class of 24 high school
   physical education students (males = 17; females = 7) from the United
   States were engaged in two consecutive seasons of invasion games using
   the SEM.
   Data collection: Data were collected utilizing a case study approach
   through qualitative measures of student and teacher interviews, as well
   as researcher field notes.
   Data analysis: Data were analyzed using the constant-comparative method.
   Results: The primary emergent themes of teacher and student experiences
   were identified as social support, winning as a team and influence on
   self-determination. Social support is further explained through two
   sub-categories of inclusion and fair play/sportspersonship. In addition,
   it was evident that distinct aspects of the SEM (e.g. team affiliation
   and an affective game play rubric) were supportive of students'
   psycho-social needs and self-determination.
   Conclusions: Structural aspects of the SEM assisted in facilitating
   movement along the self-determined continuum through support for
   relatedness, competence and autonomy. Findings indicate that time is
   needed for students to internalize prescriptive features within an
   educational setting to enhance self-determined behaviors.},

Abstract = {This study examines the links between L2 linguistic knowledge, L2
   listening strategy use, self-determined motivation, and L2 listening
   anxiety relative to L2 listening proficiency. Prior theoretical and
   empirical work suggests that these variables are interrelated in complex
   ways, and this hypothesis is tested here using structural equation
   modeling with a sample of 300 high school foreign language learners at
   the lower end of the proficiency spectrum. Our results indicate that
   intrinsic motivation yielded the strongest impact on L2 listening
   proficiency, and separately predicted greater self-regulated learning
   behavior, which in turn predicted lower levels of listening anxiety. L2
   listening strategy use was additionally associated with higher levels of
   L2 linguistic knowledge, but did not directly predict higher L2
   listening success. It was only through the mediation of L2 linguistic
   knowledge that L2 listening strategy use was linked to low L2 listening
   anxiety and higher overall L2 listening proficiency. These results are
   discussed, and we suggest that while L2 listening strategy use may be a
   key factor in reducing L2 listening anxiety, encouraging listening
   strategy use below a certain level of L2 linguistic knowledge may be of
   limited effect.},

Abstract = {Motivation is the key to success in educational institutions, and it
   empowers a teacher to work with an affection that contributes to the
   accomplishment of hierarchical objectives. Yet, what drives school
   teachers to be pleased or motivated to achieve exceptional performance?
   This contemplation must be considered thoroughly in different regions
   with different predictors. Therefore, this study aims to identify the
   factors influencing teachers' motivation and evaluate the influence of
   motivation on teachers' job performance in private schools in
   Mirpurkhas, Pakistan. We use quantitative statistics and a partial
   least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM analysis) design;
   the data was collected through a survey questionnaire. We found that
   motivation significantly influences teachers' job performance. The study
   revealed that self-determined and non-self-determined motivation and
   factors influencing teachers' motivation significantly impact teachers'
   job performance. The administration must formulate teachers'
   motivational policies and practices to meet their needs. Furthermore,
   school administrations should provide adequate resources like bonuses,
   rewards, good communication, moral support, emotional support, and an
   increment in salaries to ensure quality learning and yield high
   performance from their teaching staff to improve the relevant education
   system.},

Title = {Parental factors in children's motivation for learning English: a case
   in China},

Abstract = {Schools in China and elsewhere are starting to teach English as a second
   language or foreign language (FL) to students at increasingly earlier
   ages. Although young learners (YLs), due to their developmental stage,
   are likely to be particularly susceptible to the influence of parents,
   parents' roles in YLs' motivation to learn English as an FL is not well
   understood. Moreover, we don't fully understand why YLs lose their
   motivation to learn English by their upper elementary school years.
   Using self-determination theory, this study examined how parents'
   socio-economic status (SES) and behaviours and beliefs about their
   children's English education influenced children's motivation to learn
   English in China. The participants were 198 fourth-, 191 sixth- and 183
   eighth-grade students and their parents. Data were gathered using a
   series of surveys distributed to all the students and their parents, as
   well as interviews with 96 focus group students. Parents had substantial
   but varying influences on their children's motivation, depending on
   their SES backgrounds and their children's grade level. Whereas higher
   SES parents adjusted their behaviours according to their children's
   changing needs, lower SES parents tended to remain controlling and often
   failed to foster their children's self-competence and self-determined
   motivation. Higher SES parents' abilities to provide their children with
   greater opportunities to use English outside of school were increasingly
   advantageous for the children's development of self-determined
   motivation as their grade level increased.},

   Results. The main results showed that the most self-determined types of

Abstract = {This paper investigates how psychological needs spurring self-determined
   motivation relate to collective efficacy for flourishing in online
   learning communities. Self-determination theory posits individuals
   experience intrinsic motivation to flourish at educational tasks because
   of targeted satisfaction of the three psychological needs: autonomy,
   relatedness, and competence. However, studies conducted to investigate
   collective, technology-assisted learning processes suggest competence
   and relatedness may play a pivotal role in online community engagement
   and knowledge-sharing. Moreover, informal gaming experiences may mirror
   the collaborative skills needed in online educational/professional
   communities. These insights suggest confidence in one's abilities to
   contribute to a community, the perception of a strong, supportive social
   culture in the online classroom, and informal online experiences may
   lead to self-determined motivation enabling agents in distributed,
   technology-assisted classrooms to collectively flourish. Little work has
   been done to examine effects of need satisfaction on collective efficacy
   in using online technologies. To fill this research gap, we used
   structural equation modelling to investigate perceptions of 636
   undergraduate students enrolled in classes within an education
   department at a midwestern university employing weekly asynchronous
   blogging. Our results suggest students' experience with multiplayer
   gaming, and need satisfaction towards competence and relatedness
   correlate with higher collective efficacy in technology-assisted
   classrooms employing discussion forums.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the factors that
   influence a learner's ability to be self-directed (Andragogy) and
   self-determined (Heutagogy) may influence the understanding and
   modelling of mobile learning adoption. Heutagogy is seen as a
   progression along a continuum of pedagogical approaches from pedagogy to
   andragogy to heutagogy, where learners need to progress from each with
   the aim of becoming highly autonomous and mature learners. Due to the
   nature of mobile technology, learning can be orientated towards the
   learner to support their needs. Learners are now better equipped to
   manage and control their own learning as learning can take place
   anywhere and anytime. However not all students possess the required
   traits, such as self-management, self-control and desire for learning,
   that signal that are ready for learning that is no longer teacher-lead
   and directed.
   The study examines the results of a survey (n = 446 students) assessing
   how the traits that indicate a readiness for learning that is
   self-directed and self-determined, can impact on students' perceptions
   and adoption of mobile learning. This model was tested using structural
   equation modelling. The findings showed that there was a strong
   association with the factors of self-management, self-control and desire
   for learning on the positive perception of mobile learning and adoption.
   The study reinforces the need for scaffolding and developing learners so
   that they are comfortable to succeed in an environment that is
   self-directed and determined.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between autonomy
   support, basic psychological needs (perception of competence, autonomy
   and relatedness) and self-determined motivation on student adolescents
   to whom a deep approach to learning was applied. The sample consisted of
   405 Spanish students of Compulsory Secondary Education, High School and
   Vocational Training (212 women and 193 men), aged between 12 and 20 (M =
   16.4, DT = 2.45). The instruments used were: Student's, Perception of
   Autonomy Support, Teacher's Care, L'Echelle de Satisfaction des Besoins
   Psychologiques, Academic Motivation Scale, as well as the High School
   Version and the Revised Two Factor Study Process Questionnaire. The
   scales of Perception of Autonomy Support and Teacher's Care was
   translated into Spanish context and validated. It was carried out
   descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations), the internal
   consistency of each factor with the Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and
   bivariate correlations for all variables. In order to examine the
   predictive relationship between all proposed variables, analysis of
   models used to measure the structural relationship model was performed.
   It was found that the autonomy support applied by teachers led to a
   satisfactory prediction of psychological mediators, which in turn
   allowed for predicting the self-determined motivation in each student's
   deep-learning approach. It was concluded that a teacher, by supporting
   autonomy, can considerably motivate students so that they learn on an
   autonomous and permanent basis.},

Abstract = {Mature learners often invest a great deal of emotional energy in
   starting a higher education qualification. They have complex needs which
   are often less to do with their ability to learn and more to do with
   aspects of confidence and levels of self-belief about achieving or
   feeling `good enough' to participate. This article explores the
   relationship between the learner, the opportunities they have to engage
   with others and how learning and teaching strategies can be utilised to
   empower self-determined learning and development. An emerging paradigm
   of heutagogy or self-directed learning will be examined in the context
   of mature learners entering higher education for the first time.
   Supporting students in the process of reflective practice is ongoing,
   and this research provides a snapshot to determine whether students are
   on their way to taking control of their own learning and meaning-making
   about early childhood concepts and their implementation into practice.},

Abstract = {Purpose of review The importance of self-determination to wellbeing and
   life satisfaction has been established by research in motivation and
   education. The present review provides a synthesis of research in these
   areas at a time when the two lines of research are converging. Recent
   findings Research has established that youth and adults with
   intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are not as
   self-determined as their nondisabled peers and that this negatively
   impacts the quality of their lives. Further, research has established
   the positive benefits of a focus on self-determination assessment and
   intervention for people with IDD. Recent studies illustrate the shifting
   focus to a life-course development perspective of self-determination and
   the alignment of assessment and interventions with that perspective.
   Research on self-determination and IDD outside of the United States has
   dramatically increased. Research shows that people with IDD who are more
   self-determined achieve more positive school and adult outcomes and
   higher life satisfaction. Assessment of and interventions to promote
   self-determination have increasingly emphasized all people and are
   aligning with research in motivation and positive psychology. This
   provides a foundation for promoting greater community, school, and work

Abstract = {A cacophony of voices is continuing to place mandates on education and

   attempt to address this issue by facilitation of advocacy experiences

   graduate students, namely in early childhood education, address
   educational issues such as class size reduction, Universal Pre-K and the
   No child left behind Act, through self-determined advocacy efforts in
   early childhood education courses. The seven elements of
   service-learning include integrated learning, student voice, high
   quality service, civic responsibility, collaboration, reflection and
   evaluation. These elements serve as a framework for structuring the data
   collected from students' written reflections. Selective highlighting is
   utilized to generate the emergent themes from the data. In these case
   studies, the students who engaged in advocacy efforts through
   service-learning experienced transformations in their own perceived
   empowerment, the value of their voice, and their commitment to continued
   advocacy efforts.},

Title = {Investigating the Effect of 3D Simulation-Based Learning on the
   Motivation and Performance of Engineering Students},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {99},
Number = {3},
Pages = {237-251},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   Simulation-based Learning (SBL) was used in Machining Technology, a
   sixty-hour module for second year engineering students, at the School of
   Engineering at Temasek Polytechnic. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the effect of SBL on learners' motivation and performance.
   In assessing students' motivation, we adopted a framework based on the
   Self-determination Theory (SDT), chosen on account of its comprehensive
   treatment of the relationship between students' perceived needs
   satisfaction and their motivation.
   PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS)
   It is hypothesized that SBL, which provides learners with interactive
   learning experiences, will enhance students' motivation and performance.
   We explored the effect of SBL on students' perceived psychological needs
   satisfaction, motivation, and learning, and how SBL affected students'
   understanding and application of content knowledge.
   DESIGN/METHOD
   The intervention procedure involved the incorporation of SBL in
   Machining Technology, a 60 hour module in the mechanical engineering
   program. Survey findings and post-intervention assessment outcomes were
   used to assess the students' perceptions of their basic psychological
   needs satisfaction, motivation, and performance.
   RESULTS
   Our findings suggest that the students perceived their psychological
   needs to be satisfied and had high levels of self-determined motivation.
   Students who undertook SBL had higher mean performance test scores,
   although SBL may have differential effects on learners depending on
   factors such as gender, educational backgrounds, and IT knowledge.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Our findings suggest that the students perceived their basic
   psychological needs to be met and that SBL can potentially enhance
   self-determined motivation as well as improve learning in general.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Conducted among parents of young ice hockey players, this field
   experiment tested if making salient increasingly popular (i.e., dynamic)
   social norms that promote sportspersonship, learning, and having fun in
   sports, increases parents' own self-determined endorsement of these
   behaviors and values, improves their psychological well-being, and
   impacts on their children's on-ice behaviors. Hockey parents (N = 98)
   were randomly assigned to the experimental condition (i.e., presenting
   dynamic norms that increasingly favor sportspersonship, learning, and
   fun) vs. control condition (i.e., presenting neutral information).
   Parents' motivations for encouraging their child to learn and to have
   fun in hockey were then assessed. Score sheets for the games that
   followed the study provided access to their children's on-ice behaviors
   (i.e., penalties), as indicators of sportspersonship. Parents in the
   experimental condition reported higher self-determination for
   encouraging their child to learn and have fun in hockey compared to
   parents in the control condition. Furthermore, children of parents in
   the experimental condition had more assists. A mediation model revealed
   that the dynamic norms manipulation increased parents' self-determined
   motivation for encouraging their child to learn and to have fun in
   hockey, which in turn, predicted higher psychological well-being (i.e.,
   lower anxiety, more vitality). Together, these results provide support
   for the contention that highlighting increasingly popular social norms
   that promote sportspersonship, learning, and fun in sports, represents a
   promising strategy for creating positive social change in this life

Abstract = {This study provides a model of academic identity development for college
   students with learning disabilities from the integrative
   self-determination themes of persistence, competence, career decision
   making, and self-realization. Nineteen self-determined and
   high-achieving participants were interviewed. The participants' stories
   illustrate how persistence influences competence, which in turn
   influences career decision making and ultimately enhances
   self-realization and supports one's academic identity. Knowledge of
   one's learning disability, along with self-advocacy and conflict
   resolution skills, improved the students' ability to obtain academic
   accommodations in college settings. Secondary education implications
   include the importance of providing opportunities for students to (a)
   acquire self-knowledge about their disability, (b) autonomously practice
   self-advocacy with teachers, and (c) develop conflict resolution skills
   within the context of academic accommodation requests.},

Title = {Rewarding foreign language learning: effects of the Swedish grade point
   average enhancement initiative on students' motivation to learn French},
Journal = {LANGUAGE LEARNING JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {301-315},
Abstract = {In order to reinstate interest and motivation for learning foreign
   languages (FLs) other than English, the Swedish government has recently
   reformed the system for admission to higher education. Upper secondary
   students who continue with the FL learnt in secondary school are
   rewarded with extra credits that considerably enhance their grade point
   average (GPA). The purpose of this interview-based study is examine the
   impact of this initiative on six upper secondary students' choice to
   continue with their FL, French, and on their motivation over
   one-and-a-half semesters of study. Using self-determination theory and
   the L2 Motivational Self System model as analytical lenses, the results
   reveal that for the three students whose motivation is rooted in
   intrinsic and/ or self-determined extrinsic reasons for learning, the
   GPA-enhancing credits have little or no impact on either choice or
   effortful behaviour. For the other three students, none of whom would
   have chosen to continue with French but for the extra credits, the GPA
   enhancement is almost the sole source of motivation. However, because
   their reasons for studying French are not fully self-determined, the
   learning lacks personal meaning. These students see little longer-term
   value in their efforts, nor meaningful applications for the skills they
   have developed. Consequently, goals do not extend beyond achieving a
   passing grade. The effects on students' willingness to use the FL in the
   future and on their FL-speaking/using self-concepts of making a fifth
   and sixth year of FL learning de facto compulsory are discussed, and the
   consequences of the initiative are critically appraised.},

Abstract = {Empirical findings have repeatedly demonstrated that students'
   motivation decreases over the course of secondary education. This
   decline in learning motivation is one of the top challenges nowadays and
   is relevant for policy, as well as research and practice. Taking this
   educational challenge into account, the chapter targets the following
   questions: (1) Is a multicomponent, two-year intervention (combined
   student/teacher versus student-only intervention group) effective
   regarding the self-determined motivation and academic self-concept in
   mathematics of at-risk students? (2) How effective is the intervention
   for students with and without a migration background? And more
   generally: (3) Does the motivation (including students' academic
   self-concept as a motivational self-belief) differ between students with
   and without a migration background at three different time points
   (beginning of Grade 7, end of Grades 7 and 8)? The results indicate that
   the intrinsic motivation of the combined intervention group could be
   fostered in the first intervention year. No significant treatment effect
   could be detected for the student-only group. In line with prior
   research, students with a migration background demonstrated higher
   levels of autonomous and controlled forms of motivation. However,
   students with and without a migration background did not develop
   differently across the two years. Implications for intervention research
   addressing adolescents' self-determined motivation are discussed.},

Title = {Developing individual creativity for environmental sustainability: Using
   an everyday theme in higher education},
Journal = {THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Creativity literature was criticized for its bias towards conventional
   areas (e.g. arts), and creativity studies in domains less concerned
   about creativity, such as environmental sustainability (ES), are rare.
   This study aimed to understand the development of ``creativity for
   ES{''} (pro-ES creativity) of common tertiary students. Based on a
   pro-environmental behaviour model and a pro-sustainability competence
   model found in literature, a pro-ES creative learning curriculum was
   designed and integrated into an existing toy course in a university of
   Hong Kong. A total of 20 students from three cohorts were interviewed,
   and their feedback was analysed inductively with open-coding by the
   consensus of two experts. Together with their affecting factors, five
   learning outcomes emerged as attributes of pro-ES creativity:
   sensitivity and problem-finding; creative problem-solving abilities;
   affinity for self-creating life-style; creative systems thinking and
   futures thinking; and reconceptualization of creativity and ES. This
   study discovered that creativity, as a kind of self-actualization, had
   developed both individual competences and intrinsic motivation, which
   are conducive to life-long self-determining ES behaviours. This study
   informs the education field that the five attributes of pro-ES
   creativity can be enhanced in a curriculum based on a simple everyday
   theme. As such, pro-ES creativity education can be integrated into many
   existing curricula. Going beyond ES, this study shed light on creativity
   studies of other less popular areas. It suggested a dual
   domain-specific-general creativity education approach and a dual
   deductive-inductive research approach for developing creativity theories
   and curriculum of ``low-creativity{''} domains.},

   responsible for the learning path, hence being able to decide not only
   on how but also on what to learn {[}1]. One of the key concepts
   underpinning heutagogy is capability. It is the ability to use the
   acquired capacity in novel situations as well as in familiar ones.
   Capability represents a key concept when it comes to educating future
   workforces for the 21st century complex and ever-changing workplace
   environments {[}1]. Flexibility, the ability for to quick change and
   rapid adaptation to new situations are at the kernel of efficacy and
   productivity in those domains {[}1]. Thus, there is a strong call for
   training models that create and develop capable lifelong learners.{[}1].
   Since MOOCs are destined to masses, they would be a great tool to
   achieve changes in the training process of learners quickly and in great
   dimensions. However, MOOCs have a poor reputation in education mainly
   due to their high dropout rates. Several difficulties of MOOCs have been
   identified in the literature, such as the lack of course structure, lack
   of skills in use of tools, and lack of social and teaching presence
   {[}2]. MOOCs, therefore require self-discipline and self-guidance in a
   rather intentional way when compared to other forms of training. It
   seems to be assumed that the learners who take MOOCs have all the skills
   that would allow them to learn efficiently in such an environment.
   However, for many participants, MOOCs are the very first experience in a
   context where their responsibility and their willingness to learn might
   be challenged. It is clear that there is a gap consisting of the lack of
   guidance on how to become an efficient learner in such a
   ``non-traditional{''} learning environment as a MOOC, which creates
   feelings of intimidation and abandonment {[}2]. The principles of
   heutagogy (self-determined learning) offers elements that may help the
   developers of MOOCs overcome the problems learners may have in learning
   in an unstructured system {[}1]. Heutagogy can flourish in a Web 2.0
   environment, and it has been proposed as a framework for distance
   education {[}1]. As part of Web 2.0. MOOCs inherently carry heutagogical
   principles in their design but those should be intentional, planned and
   intensified. The aim of this paper is to discuss ways in which MOOCs can
   become real heutagogical instances. This is part of a research project,
   the main objective of which is to identify the fundamental
   characteristics for an effective heutagogical MOOC (hMOOC) and to,
   consequently, create a framework for hMOOC.},

Abstract = {Based on Deci and Ryan's self-determination theory, this study examines
   the impact of an individual's motivation in pursuing higher education

   The consequent effects upon satisfaction and behavioural intentions are
   also assessed. From a large-scale questionnaire survey with a sample of
   1919 business undergraduate students in Malaysia, this study found that
   those who are more self determined to participate in higher education
   tend to have a more favourable university service quality perception,
   which then leads to a greater level of satisfaction and student loyalty.
   The moderating effect of learning style was also found in the
   interaction between a student's motivation to participate in higher
   education and university service quality evaluation. The implication of
   this study underscores the complexity of the service quality construct
   as well as the effect of motivational differences and learning style
   upon university service quality evaluation.},

Title = {Are undergraduate students studying smart? Insights into study
   strategies and habits across a programme of study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The approach that students take in their studies at university is
   critical not only for their academic success but is equally important in
   life-long learning for their career and professional development.
   Heutagogy is the study of self-determined learning and it is important
   that we appraise how students in higher education are developing their
   metacognitive awareness in how they learn and study effectively.
   Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary research area that involves
   the scientific study of the human mind. It helps provide new knowledge
   in relation to areas such as memory, problem solving, knowledge transfer
   and understanding of complex topics. Cognitive science has demonstrated
   that re-testing oneself on material when learning, enhances and promotes
   greater retention of knowledge compared to re-reading the material.
   Learning that is distributed or spaced out over multiple study sessions
   also allows for greater retention of knowledge in the longer-term
   compared to `cramming' of information. To evaluate the use of effective
   study approaches and habits across three different levels of study in an
   undergraduate pharmacy programme, a survey study was employed. A
   paper-based survey was completed by first-, second- and third-year
   undergraduate pharmacy students (n=192) during class sessions. Although
   there was some evidence of metacognitive awareness such as using testing
   (retrieval practice) with practice problems; across all years,
   suboptimal study approaches such as rereading, copying notes and
   cramming were endorsed. A schedule of deadlines shaped the organisation
   of study and time management for most students. Self-testing was
   predominantly used to test learning rather than an approach used during
   learning. There was evidence of a difference between the cohorts in
   relation to decisions for prioritizing studying, returning to review
   course material and re-reading. The evidence from this study
   demonstrates that learners would require training on metacognitive
   awareness and effective study strategies to enable their self-determined
   learning capabilities to evolve. The linear progression through a
   programme of study alone will not achieve this. There is a need to embed
   and emphasize effective strategies for learning into curricula and for
   faculty to utilise metacognitive awareness in their teaching.
   Practitioner Notes
   1. Self-determined learning places an expectation that learners
   self-regulate and take responsibility for their learning. Student's
   independent study within a programme helps to consolidate learning.
   2. Study habits and preferences vary among individuals however there is
   clear evidence from cognitive science that not all study approaches are
   effective.
   3. Undergraduate students are using suboptimal study methods such as
   rereading notes, recopying notes and cramming information the night
   before a test. Self-testing was predominantly used to test learning
   rather than an approach used during learning.
   4. Students report that they are not using approaches taught to them by
   teachers. It has been shown that learners incorrectly predict suboptimal
   methods as superior to evidencebased approaches. We suggest that
   evidence-based study approaches are explicitly emphasised and embedded
   within courses.
   5. We recommend to senior managers with learning and teaching remits
   (Directors of Learning and Teaching, Pro Vice-Chancellors for Education
   and Student Experience) that faculty staff are informed about
   evidence-based learning approaches from cognitive science and increase
   metacognitive awareness in their teaching.},

Abstract = {Purpose To date, didactic lecturing is a common method of university
   medical training. However, higher levels of competence to solve complex
   issues are hardly to be achieved with a largely passive learning style.
   We established and evaluated a heutagogical blended learning concept to
   investigate self-determined learning with a multimedia-based,
   interactive approach in the lecture room to teach clinical radiology.
   Materials and Methods In the 2019/2020 winter semester, we included 266
   medical students in their fourth academic year in our prospective,
   observational study. Students participated in a series of 11
   radiological lectures given by 10 lecturers. They were requested to
   prepare for lectures by watching learning videos. During the lecture,
   students had to answer key-feature questions (KFQ) in small groups and
   to jointly submit their answers by means of an audience response system
   (ARS). After each lecture and the exam, we conducted surveys and
   compared results with a historical control group. A focus group
   interview with lecturers was performed after conclusion of the lecture
   series.
   Results The students' overall impression of the ``flipped classroom{''}
   concept and their examination grades were superior to historical
   controls (overall impression: 1.5 {[}95 \% CI 1.4-1.6] vs. 2.7 {[}95 \%
   CI 2.5-2.9] rated on a scale from 1 to 6, p < 0.001; examination grades:
   1.8 {[}95 \% CI 1.7-1.9] vs. 2.0 {[} 95 \% CI 1.9-2.0] rated on a scale
   from 1 to 5, p < 0.001). Most students agreed that learning videos (76.6
   \%), ARS ( 88.5 \%), KFQ (76.5 \%), and solution-oriented small group
   discussions (83.7 \%) were useful. Lecturers stated an improved
   convergence of demands on learning and clinical competence. However,
   they also emphasized an increased initial effort for implementation.
   Conclusion Students rated the overall benefit from the heutagogical
   ``flipped classroom{''} concept as high. Examination grades improved.
   According to lecturers, the ``flipped classroom{''} concept better
   matched later professional demands than traditional lectures.},

Abstract = {A multiple baseline across participants design was used to examine the
   functional relation between the Self-Determined Learning Model of
   Instruction (SDLMI) intervention and the on- and off-task behaviors of

   results showed that all four students significantly increased on-task
   behaviors and decreased off-task behaviors and all four participants
   maintained the increase of on-task behaviors and the decrease of
   off-task behaviors after the intervention was withdrawn. All four
   students made progress toward their goal of implementing on-task
   behavior in the classroom and generalized on-task behavior to a second
   general education classroom. The study provides evidence of effective
   self-determination instruction that supports students to improve their
   behavior in a general education classroom. Implications for practice and

Title = {Physical Activity Programs in Shanxi Province Schools in China: Effects
   of In-School and After-School Delivery on Students' Motivational and
   Social Outcomes},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Effective physical activity (PA) programs may enhance students'
   awareness, competence, and motivation to participate in PA in the future
   for their health and mental well-being. The most effective way to
   accomplish this is through in-school and after-school activities.
   However, certain obstacles (traditional ways) may prevent some students
   from gaining these benefits. By eliminating these and other barriers,
   transforming after-school PA programs into in-school PA programs can
   enhance access to PA services. Despite this, the change in learning
   context from after-school to in-school may affect student engagement and
   program effectiveness by altering the interaction between students and
   teachers. Self-determination theory was employed to explain how the
   learning context affects motivation and social outcomes in PA programs
   for primary school students. The study involved 513 students from 12
   different schools in Shanxi Province, China, in 2022. They represented
   46.24\% girls and 53.76\% boys, ranging in age from 9 to 12. Teachers
   conducted PA programs to motivate students to participate in healthy
   activities. Assessment of student-teacher interactions, psychological
   needs satisfaction, and motivation was conducted among PA students
   through questionnaires. Relationships between students and teachers were
   incorporated into a structural equation model as direct and mediated
   determinants of motivation for attendance PA programs. There is
   agreement between the results and the hypothesized model, which predicts
   higher levels of psychological need satisfaction and higher levels of
   intrinsic motivation. In addition, the learning context only negatively
   affects less-self-determined motivations. Results confirm that positive
   perceptions of teachers by students play a significant role in promoting
   incentives for PA program participation in more self-determined manners.
   Furthermore, innovative strategies to reduce the detrimental effects of
   long-standing institutional structures and procedures should be
   considered and incorporated into in-school programs that motivate
   students to participate in these programs.},

Abstract = {The present study has a twofold objective. Firstly, following the
   fundamental principles of the Self-Determination Theory, it presents an
   analysis of the motivational processes that occur in the Physical
   Education classroom; secondly, taking as support the educational
   approach of Motor Co-Opedagogy and the pedagogical models of Cooperative
   Learning and Personal and Social Responsibility, it sets out the design
   of an intervention proposal for an Inclusive Physical Education Didactic
   Unit. For data collection, the questionnaires adapted to the Spanish
   context of the Basic Psychological Needs Measurement Scale (BPNES) and
   the Perceived Locus of Causality in Physical Education Scale (PLOC
   Scale) were used with a sample of 30 students, aged between 16 and 17
   years, enrolled in 1st year of high school. The results reveal the
   positive relationship between the satisfaction of Basic Psychological
   Needs (BPN) for learning and the adoption of more self-determined
   behaviours and the processes of identified, introjected and external
   regulation. Furthermore, the data associated higher levels of the three
   BPNs for learning in boys than in girls. Based on the results obtained,
   an intervention proposal for an Inclusive Physical Education Didactic
   Unit was designed.},

   Self-Determination Theory of Motivation. The theory distinguishes mainly
   four types of motivation, namely Intrinsic Motivation, Identified
   Regulation, External Regulation and Amotivation. Students were found to
   exhibit more self-determined types of motivation during the Hour of Code

Abstract = {The paper presents findings of an explorative research (non-probable
   sample, N-147), aiming at considering the level of development of
   meta-components of learning autonomy, (metacognitive abilities, learning
   strategies and critical thinking), as indicators of higher education
   teaching quality, which were involved as components of the European
   qualification framework. Theoretical grounds of the paper are
   contemporary didactical concepts of emancipatory learning, implying
   intellectual autonomy as outcome of didactic approach to learning in
   teaching, meaning that those who learn ``manage themselves{''} during
   learning so that they gradually take responsibility for their own
   learning.
   Basic finding refers to the following: there is a small number of
   students with developed metacognitive abilities, expected levels of
   critical thinking and efficient learning strategies, implying poor
   reaches of higher education teaching in view of meta-components of
   intellectual autonomy, anticipated as components of European
   qualification framework. Furthermore, this implies that more attention
   in teaching is paid to self-organized and self-determined learning, so
   that the greatest change introduced by realization of learning autonomy
   and anticipated by European qualification framework is the change of
   didactic approach to learning in teaching, arising out of contemporary
   didactic concepts of emancipatory learning, according to which teaching
   and learning lead in the direction opposite to the one which existed
   before, meaning that those who learn manage themselves during learning
   so that they could gradually take responsibility for their own learning.},

Abstract = {Since 2014 one focus of our research is looking into the effects of
   integrating Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in traditional
   education. We have developed in the past different methods of
   integration: as a full course recognition, partial course recognition,
   or project/activity based recognition of a MOOCs course completion, into
   a traditional higher education face-to-face course. The experience on
   integrating MOOCs in courses at Master level is presented and discussed
   in this paper. The analyse is based on questionnaires, reports and live
   discussions with students, during the whole academic semester. Studying
   online, open education and MOOCs still represent terms students are not
   familiar with, in Romania in particular. Still, we consider that the
   Open Life Long Learning Student need to acquire a new set of skills in
   an independent and self-determined manner as to identify, access, learn,
   analyse, apply and practice new knowledge using different media,
   information channels, and communication tools to enhance their skills
   and develop their careers. The authors proposed an asynchronous online
   course work to be integrated with the traditional in-class instruction.
   We looked into the students' interaction with MOOCs, the use of
   different tools, the educational value of learning online and the MOOCs
   impact. The conclusions present both strengths and deficiencies of
   integrating MOOCs based on this blended learning study case.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of neurodivergent learners attend higher education.
   This necessitates examination of best-fit learning models to
   successfully support the current generation of college students. While
   pedagogy and andragogy have historical relevance, in isolation, they may
   lack alignment with the individualization embedded in
   neurodiversity-affirming practice. This study conceptualized a novel
   learning framework for neurodivergent college students through the lens
   of neurodiversity-affirming practice. Via constant comparative
   qualitative analysis of American university faculty interviews and
   framework juxtaposition, three themes were identified: pedagogy vs.
   andragogy, self-determination, and interdependency. Thematic analysis
   revealed uncertainty regarding best-fit learning framework, with
   consensus reached regarding complexity of serving neurodivergent adults
   in post-secondary settings. An innovative framework titled ``Building a
   Heutagogical Bridge{''} was envisioned, describing the role of
   heutagogy, student-centered, self-determined learning, in connecting
   signature pedagogical and andragogical approaches. This study revealed
   the potentiality of implementing and assessing approaches to skillfully
   incorporate heutagogical, pedagogical, and andragogical principles in
   higher education settings. The perspectives of faculty from the USA
   within this study can inform neurodiversity-affirming practice in
   American universities, while providing implications for future study and
   practice in international college settings, where contexts, needs, and
   culture may differ.},

Title = {Game-based learning apps in engineering education: requirements, design
   and reception among students},

Abstract = {There is a lack of research on how game-based learning apps should be
   designed for engineering education. This paper addresses two research
   questions: What do engineering students expect from a learning app?
   Which educational approach and learning app design can meet these
   requirements? A survey revealed the particular demands of engineering
   students when using learning apps. They prefer apps that promote
   transfer of learning. They value a diversified game environment that
   leaves room for self-determined decisions. They want to use learning
   apps during five-minute breaks or on-the-go. Social interaction is only
   of minor importance. Concrete design and content guidelines are derived.
   Perceptual learning is an appropriate educational approach to meet the
   requirements. Two universally applicable task types for engineering
   education are discussed. A case study was conducted to investigate their
   use in practice. Following the guidelines, an app for
   heat-and-mass-transfer was generated and its impact on teaching was
   evaluated. Students considered that their requirements were met. This is
   reflected in the usage statistics: During one semester, 545 different
   students played a total of 27,350 games. As a measure of learning
   progress, the average score per game almost tripled. Apps that follow
   the guidelines have the potential to become well-accepted learning
   tools.},

Abstract = {IntroductionLGBTQ+ patients continue to face high levels of
   discrimination and disparities in healthcare environments partly due to
   a lack of accessible affirming healthcare providers. Providers in LGBTQ+
   healthcare may have unrecognized gaps in their affirmation due to a lack
   of continual education and training after achieving a self-determined
   high standard. It is unclear how an LGBTQ+ training would affect
   self-reported clinical attributes of LGBTQ+ healthcare
   providers.MethodSelf-identified LGBTQ+ affirming providers (N = 131)
   received an online LGBTQ+ training. Participants completed a survey
   consisting of demographic questions and the seven-point Likert LGBT
   Development of Clinical Skills Scale (LGBT-DOCSS) immediately before,
   right after, and three months following the training.ResultProviders had
   very high baseline LGBT-DOCSS scores prior to training. Clinical
   Preparedness and Basic Knowledge significantly increased immediately
   following training and improvements were sustained at three
   months.ConclusionDespite achieving high baselines of LGBTQ+ preparedness
   and knowledge, LGBTQ+ affirming providers can continue to learn and
   improve and likely need regular ongoing education and training to
   maintain high levels of affirmation in the rapidly evolving field of
   LGBTQ+ healthcare.},

   assess psychological reactions. A repeated measures comparison for each
   motivation and mood variable was conducted using mixed-model analysis.
   Changes in all moods were significant at week 7, when the greatest
   number of assessment items per student was due. For this particular
   week, negative moods also increased, along with a decrease in the
   positive mood of vigour. The intrinsic motivation variables of
   interest/enjoyment and perceived competence were significantly lower in
   week 7, with pressure/tension being significantly higher. For this group
   of students the demands of assessment have been shown to have a

   evidence-based practice designed to promote self-determination, the
   Self-Determined Learning Model of Instruction (SDLMI), in inclusive,

   limited research on the impact of teacher implementation supports (i.e.,
   online only versus online + coaching supports) on the content of the
   goals students choose using the SDLMI, particularly in inclusive,
   secondary classrooms where students are learning core content. The
   findings suggested that the vast majority of goals set by students in
   inclusive, general education classes focused on academic learning and
   minimal differences across goals set by students with and without

   on students' learning and personal growth, using a narrative research
   method. Seventy Chinese undergraduate students generated personal
   reflective journals and eight participants' journals were selected to
   enter into the narrative-oriented inquiry. Our analysis revealed a
   number of primary themes based on which we produced a meta-story. The
   supplements of the story were exacted for further critical cross-case
   discussion. The finding indicated that the multifaceted development of
   mindful agency involved learning methods, emotional regulation,
   strategic thinking, and awareness of planning, openness to experience,
   self-acceptance and self-esteem, and learning engagement, with enhanced
   sense of personal awareness and awakening. The coaching was supportive
   for students to foster positive self-identities and become more

Journal = {STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {748-762},
Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {In discussing the functions of education Gert Biesta distinguishes
   qualification, socialisation and subjectification. In subjectification
   higher education facilitates the evolution of students as distinctive
   self-determining persons. This paper foregrounds and discusses `student
   self-formation', a paradigm of subjectification with fecund potentials
   for empirical inquiry. Self-formation emphasises reflexive agency,
   whereby students consciously monitor and develop themselves on an
   ongoing basis. The paper draws especially on Margaret Archer's
   discussion of reflexive agency. It argues that the core features of
   self-formation that are specific to higher education are engagement in
   disciplinary knowledge, and in activities and relations beyond the
   classroom that are part of student life. Student self-formation is both
   a norm to be achieved, with lifelong learning potentials, and a
   descriptor of existing practices. By its nature self-formation is never
   complete and its incidence is uneven among students, with some of them
   scarcely experiencing it. Conditions and potentials for reflexive
   self-formation vary on the basis of factors including the degree of
   immersion in higher education, the scope for agentic initiative,
   personal resources and support, institutional and pedagogic resources
   and arrangements, and existential challenges (e.g. transitions between
   countries and cultures) that can trigger accelerated self-reflection and
   transformation.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE PSICODIDACTICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study is two-fold: (a) to analyze whether the
   cooperative learning factors discriminate the different approach goals
   of the 3 x 2 achievement goals model and, consequently, (b) to assess
   the role that can play educational stage. A total of 1292 students
   participate (660 men and 632 women) belonging to the educational stages
   of primary (580), secondary (531) and baccalaureate (181), with ages
   between 10 and 19 years (M= 13.05, SD= 2.45). The CAC and CML 3 x 2-EF
   questionnaires are administered as data collection instruments. The
   results of the discriminant analysis have shown that the cooperative
   learning factors are predictors of the approach goals, highlighting the
   individual responsibility factor for the task-approach goals (TAG) and
   self-approach goals (SAG), this being the least discriminant for the
   other-approach goals. In addition, the results of the decision tree
   analysis indicate that in primary education, secondary education and
   baccalaureate, the students with the highest level in TAG and SAG are
   those that score the highest in individual responsibility. These
   findings reflect the importance of individual responsibility so that
   physical education students show more adaptive patterns such as TAG and
   SAG. (C) 2020 Universidad de Pais Vasco. Published by Elsevier Espana,

   Physical Education Teachers},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Gamification is a new methodological tool in the field of physical
   education and sports sciences, which seeks to generate a formative
   change in educational centers and in the training of future teachers.
   The aim of the research was to analyze the effect of gamification on
   motivation, basic psychological needs and cooperative learning of
   prospective physical education teachers. The sample consisted of 102
   future teachers in the specific area of physical education and sport.
   Three measuring instruments were used: Motivational Situation Scale,
   Cooperative Learning Questionnaire and Basic Psychological Needs in
   Physical Education Scale. The significance level (p < 0.05) was
   determined according to the variables described. The results were
   analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis test for the variables age and study
   group and the Mann-Whitney U-test for gender. The results show high
   values for basic psychological needs, motivation and cooperative
   learning. In the case of cooperative learning, gamification has a
   different behavior according to gender. By degree, gamification does not
   affect the degree of study in the same way. In conclusion, the results
   of the present study support the use of gamification in the training of
   future physical education teachers, as it is associated with increased
   levels of students' intrinsic and self-determined motivation, basic
   psychological needs and cooperative learning.},

Abstract = {Given the emphasis on promoting self-determination in the field of
   special education and the corresponding use of scales to measure
   self-determination in research and practice, it is important to examine
   whether widely used self-determination assessments measure the same
   constructs among and between students from different disability
   categories. This study examined the equivalence of measurement and
   structural parameters of The Arc's Self-Determination Scale (SDS) across
   groups of students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) or
   learning disabilities (LD), using a two-group confirmatory factor
   analysis (CFA). The results indicated that four essential elements of
   self-determined behavior that form the structure of the SDS (i.e.,
   autonomy, self-regulation, psychological empowerment, and
   self-realization) are invariant across the two groups. In addition,
   students with EBD indicated lower levels of autonomy compared with those
   with LD. Implications and future directions for research and practice
   are discussed.},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {We examined the effect of three components of
   self-determination-autonomy, empowerment, and self-realization-on the
   postsecondary enrollment of English learners with disabilities, using
   quasi-experimental propensity score modeling and data from the National
   Longitudinal Transition Study-2. Results support the hypothesis that
   self-determination components affect postsecondary school enrollment.
   English learners with disabilities with higher autonomy scores were more
   likely to enroll in 2-year colleges, and those with higher empowerment
   scores were more likely to enroll in 4-year colleges. However, prior
   research found that English learners with disabilities are less likely
   to act autonomously or report empowerment-related behaviors than other
   students with disabilities or students in the general population.
   Considering the increasing importance of postsecondary education, the
   current study's findings demonstrate the importance of promoting both
   the self-determined behaviors of this dually identified population of
   students and the learning environment supports that facilitate the
   practice of self-determination.},

Title = {New European Learners? An analysis of the `trendsetter' thesis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF YOUTH STUDIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {377-391},
Abstract = {This paper draws on life history interviews with young adults in the UK
   to consider Manuela du Bois-Reymond's claims about the increasing
   prevalence of `trendsetter learners' across Europe. Du Bois-Reymond has
   argued that certain groups of young adults are at the forefront of
   developing new forms of learning in response to what they perceive to be
   the failings of formal education - namely the disjuncture between theory
   and practice within the education that they are offered and a lack of
   respect from many of the teachers with whom they come into contact.
   These young adults, she contends, are the `trendsetter learners',
   creating youth cultural capital that helps them to realise
   self-determined ways of living and learning. In considering some of
   these claims, this paper draws on data from the `Young Graduates and
   Lifelong Learning' project funded by the UK's Economic and Social
   Research Council. Between September 2005 and January 2006, 90 in-depth
   life history interviews were conducted with graduates from six higher
   education institutions. Our findings suggest that the degree of
   autonomy, freedom and creativity in young people's patterns of learning
   that underpin du Bois-Reymond's analysis is over-stated. We argue that,
   while du Bois-Reymond's work makes an important contribution to
   conceptualising the ways in which young Europeans engage with learning,
   her dichotomy between `trendsetter' learners and their `disengaged'
   counterparts overlooks: complexities inherent in this relationship, the
   social status attached to particular forms of more traditional education
   and training, and the structuring nature of much workplace learning.},

Abstract = {Evaluation of learning and the development of prelicensure nursing
   education include an exploration of new teaching models and techniques
   for student learning assessment. The utilization of high-fidelity human
   simulation in nursing provides nursing faculty and students the
   opportunity to expand the boundaries of conventional learning from an
   instructional paradigm to a blending of modalities that enrich the
   student experience and provide an avenue for self-determined learning.
   The inception of computer-generated high-fidelity human simulation
   technology into the undergraduate nursing curriculum generated this
   correlation study, which examined two separate groups of senior
   baccalaureate nursing students' reported self-efficacy for providing
   family-centered care. This research examined each group of students'
   reported self-efficacy on the first day of the pediatric semester before
   and after simulation and on the last day of the pediatric semester
   before and after simulation. In addition, the relationship between two
   senior baccalaureate nursing student groups' reported self-efficacy at
   four data points was examined. The concluding data identified that
   senior baccalaureate nursing students have unrealistic self-assessments
   of their clinical knowledge and nursing performance capabilities before
   simulation scenario participation. The perceived ability of
   undergraduate students to self-identify their previously acquired
   knowledge and transferable clinical reasoning to family-centered
   situations is inaccurate. Human simulators are an effective teaching and
   learning modality in measuring factors that affect student outcomes.},

   examined the self-determination prospects of 196 youth with emotional

   Self-Determination Scale. Teachers reported the capacities of youth with
   EBD to engage in self-determined behavior to be significantly lower than

   problem behavior ratings both emerged as significant predictors of
   students' capacity for self-determination but were not associated with
   the opportunities for self-determination teachers reported providing at
   school. Teachers generally evaluated students' capacity for
   self-determination lower than youth but higher than parents.

   Social Sustainability},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 8},
Abstract = {Education for social sustainability rests on (1) individual learning
   agency, and (2) graduates prepared in relations between the individual
   and collective society, in the context of open ontology and emerging
   ecological, social and political challenges. The self-determining
   learner in higher education, with antecedents in Confucian
   self-cultivation and Bildung, is engaged in conscious self-formation,
   incorporating reflexive autonomous agency, the will to learn, and
   immersion in knowledge and relational experiences. Self-making is
   pervasive in other spheres of life suggesting that it can become
   integral to higher education. The article reviews self-formation, and
   individual/social relations, in two traditions: the Chinese
   civilisational zone and Euro-America. It focuses especially on the
   double-coded self in each tradition (the reflexive coupling of the inner
   self and social self), emerging forms of individuality in China, and
   Michel Foucault's account of the impact of early Christianity in
   separating the individual and social in Euro-America. In the Sinic
   configuration, individual growth and social responsibility are well
   understood but the individual is crowded by layers of social demands.
   Euro-America gives students more room but renders the social domain
   opaque: individual detachment from social responsibility is rife. What
   is needed is a half-way house: students free from coercion who are
   prepared in their duties to the community.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to know the relations between both theories
   through motivation, motivational climate and the importance of Physical
   Education (PE). The sample consisted of 1298 Spanish students (626 males
   = 48.2\%; 672 females = 51.8\%). Secondary schools students from the
   provinces of Almeria, Granada and Malaga participated. The age range was
   between 12 and 19 years (M = 15. 13) (SD = 1.43), the boys' age average
   being 15.26 (SD = 1.42) and that of the girls being 15.01 (SD = 1.43)
   years. We used a questionnaire which included Sports Motivation Scale
   (SMS), Learning and Performance Orientations in Physical Education
   Classes Questionnaire (LAPOPECQ) and Importance of PE (IPE). MANOVA was
   performed. The results of this study show that PE students in high
   school have a higher intrinsic than extrinsic motivation, and that there
   is an even greater motivation among boys than among girls. Furthermore,
   among students, the perception of motivational climate for learning is
   greater than for performance, although the boys perceive a greater
   performance climate. Boys also ascribe greater importance and utility to
   PE. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open

Abstract = {A web based organic chemistry practice tool that increases active
   learning has been shown to result in improved student success in an
   organic chemistry course. Undergraduate level organic chemistry courses
   require students to solve different kinds of problems. Of these,
   students generally find multi-step synthesis to be the most challenging.
   We built an online practice environment that provides students with
   practice and guidance in solving multi-step synthesis problems. Student
   performance in multi-step synthesis problems in class assessments was
   collected and compared to website usage for organic chemistry classes in
   2011 and 2012.
   For both the 2011 and the 2012 classes, statistical analysis shows that
   website usage is connected to increased performance on multi-step
   synthesis problems. A covariate analysis was used to correct for other
   student-centric factors such as diligence and background knowledge. We
   also studied motivational factors that influence students' website usage
   and performance. Data was also collected that showed how the students
   interacted with the site, and their perceptions of its usefulness.
   Student website usage is found to be positively correlated with some
   motivational factors on particular, specifically self-determination.
   Engagement with the site and perceptions of its usefulness are also
   highest for students who are more self-determined.},

Title = {A review of recent research in EFL motivation: Research trends, emerging
   methodologies, and diversity of researched populations},
Journal = {SYSTEM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {103},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The increasing interest in English as a foreign language (EFL) across
   the globe has necessitated learning opportunities that engage and
   sustain students' motivation to learn English. This paper aims to
   provide an analysis of trends in EFL motivation between 2016 and 2020.
   While examining 90 studies published during this time frame, we have
   focused on an overview of methodologies, theories, and backgrounds of
   researched populations. We have also aimed to summarize the key findings
   of the literature in order to discuss the emergent themes in current EFL
   motivation research. Hence, this paper offers a comprehensive analysis
   and synthesis of recent EFL motivation research trends. Although 24
   countries and economies were represented, many studies came from Taiwan
   and China. Furthermore, most of the studies featured socioeconomically
   privileged students and students at the higher levels of education, with
   few mentions of disadvantaged populations. We found extensive use of
   technology, through which we can identify a viable path for enhancing
   language learning, teaching, and future research. This review highlights
   the need for sustainable interventions and studies with diverse
   populations in the expanding field of EFL.},

Volume = {76},

Abstract = {Reviews of the literature have confirmed the influence of
   autonomy-supportive teaching on student self-determined motivation and
   enhancement of skill in various educational contexts influencing
   students to be more engaged in their learning in addition to having
   higher levels of perceived skill improvement. Unfortunately, not much of
   the literature directly examines the autonomy-supportive language that
   teachers naturally use in physical education. Therefore, this study
   determined how and when teachers use autonomy-supportive behaviors
   within the context of a regular physical education (PE) class. Four high
   school PE teachers (2 male, 2 female, all Caucasian, M-age = 41.25, SD =
   11.84) and 140 high school students (M-age = 14.90, SD = 1.01) in
   compulsory co-educational classes participated in the study. Teachers'
   verbal behaviors were audio recorded during four 90-min classes for
   three of the teachers and eight 45-min classes for the remaining
   teacher. Audio data were transcribed verbatim. Class observations and
   field notes also contributed to the analysis and helped the researchers
   to contextualize data collected via recordings. Findings indicate that
   teachers used a variety of autonomy-supportive behaviors, some more
   often than others. Some behaviors were underrepresented and, in some
   cases, were observed in an interconnected nature. The low use of some
   behaviors suggests room for improvement, with the benefits of such
   behaviors more directly influencing student motivation and enhancing
   skill learning.},

Volume = {44},

Pages = {1095-1110},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study adopted self-determination theory as means to understanding
   the motivation of university music students. The self-determination
   theory framework contends that three psychological needs of competence,
   relatedness, and autonomy must be fulfilled in order to maintain
   psychological wellbeing. In turn, needs fulfilment results in autonomous
   motivation, in which activities are perceived to be aligned with the
   self and are consequently experienced as personally important,
   interesting, and enjoyable. We surveyed students (N = 392) from schools
   of music in nine universities in Australia and New Zealand to examine
   whether needs fulfilment and autonomous motivation within the university
   music learning context would explain context-specific affect and
   behaviour. Hypothesised relationships were tested using structural
   equation modelling. Psychological needs fulfilment and autonomous
   motivation explained more frequent practice, more frequent quality
   practice, and a higher preference for challenging tasks. This study is
   among the first self-determination theory studies in the domain of music
   learning at the university level, and thus the results are described in
   terms of the potential of this theory to more fully explain interesting
   and under-researched aspects of this environment, including student
   wellbeing, anxiety, preparations for a long-term career in music, and
   pedagogical implications.},

Abstract = {Outreach science labs have been established as non-formal out-of-school
   learning environments in the fields of science, technology, engineering,
   and mathematics. Previous research has suggested that visiting an
   outreach science lab can be beneficial in terms of student motivation.
   Nevertheless, the current research on these out-of-school learning
   environments lacks studies that investigate important variables for the
   development of self-determined student motivation, such as perceived
   competence. In our study, we investigated the moderating effect of the
   learning environment on the relationship between students' contextual
   competence perceptions and their situational competence experiences
   regarding experimentation. For this purpose, 119 students in the first
   year of the upper secondary school participated in an experimental
   course on enzymology at an outreach science lab (n = 60) and in their
   biology classroom at school (n = 59). Our results showed that the
   relationship between students' contextual competence perceptions and
   their situational competence experiences during experimentation is
   moderated by the learning environment. The analyses revealed that
   students with a higher contextual competence perception showed
   comparable situational experiences of competence in both learning
   environments. In contrast, the students who perceived themselves as less
   competent at a contextual level benefited from experimenting at the
   outreach science lab in terms of their situational competence
   experiences.},

   Using a piece-wise growth model, we found stability in teacher
   perceptions of their implementation over a 2-year period even with the
   introduction of a second transition-focused intervention to a subset of
   the sample. Using a mediation model, we then found a complex
   relationship between teacher perceptions of fidelity and student
   outcomes on the SDI:SR. We found that teacher-perceived fidelity over
   the course of the year was influenced by students' beginning of the year
   self-determination status and that teacher-perceived fidelity then
   affected students' end of the year self-determination status. The
   findings suggest an interactive relationship between teacher perceptions

Abstract = {PurposeDue to the need for high-quality teaching, we present a new
   blended learning concept combining digital modules, interactive
   seminars, and clinical experience. Furthermore, we evaluated its
   acceptance among students.MethodsA new concept for teaching was applied
   to the radiotherapy module and made available via the Hannover Medical
   School (MHH) learning management system as part of a blended learning
   concept with educational films, multimedia learning modules, online
   seminars, and onsite practical training. The evaluation recorded
   assessments of the requirement profile, design, and opportunities for
   skills acquisition; evaluation of the seminar and internship; and
   questions on the overall assessment.ResultsThe new concept was applied
   to four passes in the fourth academic year. A total of 152 students
   completed the radio-oncology learning module, which was evaluated by 46
   students. Forty students considered the course duration to be
   appropriate for the material covered, and most students stated that
   their prior knowledge had been sufficient. The level of difficulty of
   the content was rated by the students as somewhat too high. The design
   of the digital course, the opportunity to acquire skills, the seminar
   course, and the practical course were mostly rated
   positively.ConclusionThrough digital redesign, a teaching concept can be
   implemented that combines self-determined learning, professional
   exchange with doctors, and clinical practice experience. The concept can
   be transferred to other areas because it combines theoretical knowledge
   transfer with synchronous teaching and clinical experience. The results
   of the evaluation show that the students rated the new concept well.},

Title = {Enhanced student perceptions of learning and performance using

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Background Active learning pedagogy has recently received a great deal
   of attention, and many universities have attempted to create
   student-centered learning environments to improve students' academic
   success. The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of
   concept-point-recovery (CPR) teaching sessions as an active learning
   strategy on students' perceptions of the learning environment,
   motivation, and academic learning outcomes in an electrical engineering
   course. To investigate the effectiveness of CPR sessions, students'
   perceptions of learning and their performance were compared to those of
   students in a control classroom. Finally, students' written comments on
   the course and instructor were explored in further analysis. Results The
   quantitative findings revealed that there was a significant change in
   students' perceptions of learning after the CPR teaching sessions, and
   there was an increase in students' perceptions and learning outcomes
   compared with those of the control group. In addition, the qualitative
   findings from students' written feedback demonstrated that students felt
   that the instructor cared about students' learning and success and that
   they had a positive learning environment. Conclusions CPR teaching
   sessions can be an alternative model for instructors to connect with
   students and create supportive environments to help students achieve
   academic success, which in turn promotes the satisfaction of students'
   basic psychological needs and self-determined motivation. Therefore,
   increasing students' engagement in their learning processes and making
   connections with students through CPR teaching sessions can facilitate
   improvements in students' motivation and academic success. How this new
   active learning technique can be applied to higher education is
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of a Physical
   Education (PE)-based Sport Education (SE) program on personal and
   interpersonal variables, social environment, and the predisposition of
   acquiring positive habits and autonomy in high school students in order
   to assess the contribution of this model to the students' citizenship
   education. A sample of 123 adolescents, 60 boys and 63 girls,
   participated in the present study. Students were divided into one
   control (CG) and one experimental (EG) group. EG performed 12 PE-lessons
   of SE intervention based on volleyball small-sided games and educational
   competitions. CG followed a traditional treatment of sport in PE, mixing
   tasks with small-sided games and direct instruction methodologies.
   Results showed that EG participants had a statistically significant
   increase in the scores of the following dimensions: personal (the
   self-determined motivation toward PE, satisfaction/enjoyment toward
   sport, and the physical self-concept); interpersonal (relatedness with
   others, cooperative learning, and important role within a work-group);
   social (PE classroom climate, and sportspersonship); and autonomy and
   acquisition of habits (autonomy support, and the intention to be
   physically active) compared with the CG (p < .001). A SE intervention in
   PE will allow teachers to improve students' citizenship competences.},

Abstract = {As `self-law', autonomy contributes to people's psychological health and
   helps secure meaning in one's life. Within higher education, it enables
   students to navigate this environment and prepare for professional life,
   empowering them to take ownership of their learning and development
   goals. Autonomy is multidimensional, encompassing the local ability to
   regulate thoughts and behaviours, and the global ability to establish a
   sense of existential agency; therefore, it is vital to students'
   holistic progression and attainment. Within a relational context,
   interpersonal relationships influence people's ability to recognise and
   exercise their autonomous capacities across local and global contexts.
   Therefore, fostering students' autonomy is at the heart of support
   services within Higher Education Institutions. Student Advisers are well
   placed to undertake this mission, given the range of academic,
   administrative, and pastoral responsibilities their role entails. In
   this paper we provide a taxonomy of student autonomy, arguing it is
   `becoming oneself amongst others'. Given autonomy's relational
   foundations, a healthy student-adviser connection can provide an
   environment for students to operate in a co-directive and
   self-determined manner. Drawing on University College Dublin's Student
   Advisory Services, we offer guidance to Student Advisers, proposing two
   autonomy enhancement strategies: fostering students' self-governance
   through facilitating intrapersonal ownership and fostering their
   self-direction by promoting interpersonal embeddedness.},

Abstract = {Among students with disabilities, the largest two groups in
   postsecondary educational settings are students with specific learning
   disability (SLD) and students with attention deficit hyperactivity
   disorder (ADHD). These students can experience difficulty in achieving
   goals in academics and their personal lives. At the University of
   Arizona, the Strategic Alternative Learning Techniques Center provides
   comprehensive services for approximately 600 students with learning and
   attention challenges. This study aimed to explore students' perceptions
   of self-determination to improve the quality of departmental programing
   with better preventions and interventions. The AIR Self-Determination
   Scale was completed by 641 participants. Using both quantitative and
   qualitative methods, the research team gained an in-depth understanding
   of the enrolled students. Overall, most students viewed themselves as
   sometimes performing self-determined behaviors and almost always to
   always provided opportunities. Moreover, they had a high level of
   Thinking and medium level of Doing and Adjusting. When comparing
   students by gender, ethnicity, and disability groups, female students'
   perceptions of self-determination were significantly higher than male
   students; no significant differences across ethnicity categories were
   found; SLD group's rating was the highest. Adopting a general inductive
   approach, three main themes, Academic Goals, Health Goals, and
   Employment and Finance Goals, were identified. Awareness of different
   demographic groups, myth busting, and supports were also discussed to
   provide useful strategies for college students with learning and
   attention challenges.},

Abstract = {Flipped learning is a pedagogical approach that directs instruction from
   a group to an individual learning space. This approach can stimulate
   students' motivation, promote adequate physical activity levels, and
   reduce sedentary (SED) behaviour. Addressing the literature gap
   regarding the correlations among these factors in school physical
   education (PE), this study aimed to examine the association of students'
   motivation, physical activity levels, and SED behaviour with flipped
   learning in a four-lesson learning unit. Framed by self-determination
   theory, a quasi-experimental design was adopted to measure and compare
   the moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), SED, and motivation
   levels of 111 primary school students aged between 10 and 11 years (mean
   = 10.07, standard deviation = .26) in Hong Kong. Fifty-two of the
   participants were female, and 59 were male. They were randomly assigned
   to experimental (n = 57) and control (n = 54) groups, in which a flipped
   learning approach was adopted in the experimental group for two weeks. A
   questionnaire survey and accelerometers were used to measure
   participants' motivation (autonomous motivation, controlled motivation,
   and amotivation) and their physical activity levels. The findings
   revealed significantly higher MVPA levels and lower SED levels in the
   experimental group. Autonomous motivation was found to have a positive
   correlation with MVPA levels and a negative correlation with SED levels,
   indicating a positive predictor of the two. The findings of this study
   reveal the potential of flipped learning to enhance students' MVPA and
   reduce their SED behaviour during primary school PE lessons.},

Abstract = {The goal of this research was to explore cognitive, self-determined
   learning and autonomous motivational effects in the context of a mobile
   science exhibition (N=256) in Finland. The pupils were sixth-graders
   with an average age of 12 years 6 months. Autonomy experience, as
   measured by the Relative Autonomy Index (RAI), had an effect on how the
   pupils liked learning science both at school and in a science centre
   context. The more autonomous that students feel, the more likely it is
   that they have intrinsic motivation in learning science. The RAI also
   predicted momentary situational motivation. The most important enhancer
   of situation motivation was liking science learning at school, but this
   was true only among boys; nevertheless, in general, girls were somewhat
   more motivated by the science exhibition than boys. There was no gap
   between boys and girls in post-knowledge testing, suggesting that girls
   benefitted more from the science centre learning experience than boys.
   Although gender differences in the knowledge tests leveled, students
   having higher reasoning ability, measured by Raven, gained more from the
   exhibition than the others. Post-knowledge was explained most by
   pre-knowledge, but the overall substantial learning results were
   enhanced directly and indirectly by the motivational factors. The
   practical implication for the science centres is to offer both teachers
   and pupils learning materials to be used before and after the visits.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {For transformation to occur in learning environments and for learners,
   higher education must first consider how such transformation will occur
   for the designers and facilitators of learning experiences: the
   university teachers or educators we call faculty (in the US),
   instructors, lecturers or professors or, in some instances, university
   staff. For the purpose of this article, we will refer to them as
   educators or faculty, and the process of their professional development
   as educational development or faculty development (more historically
   common in the US context). We aspire towards universities in the future
   that cultivate connected, participatory educational development that
   crosses institutional and national boundaries, and which takes equity,
   social justice and power differences into consideration, promoting
   educator agency. We propose theoretical underpinnings of our approach,
   while also highlighting some examples of recent practice that inspire
   this direction, but which are small in scale, and can provide
   springboards for future approaches that may be applied on a wider scale
   and become more fully integrated, supported and rewarded in
   institutions. Our theoretical underpinnings are influenced by theories
   of heutagogy and self-determined learning, transformative learning,
   connectivist and connected learning, and an interest in equity.We share
   models of alternative approaches to educator development that take
   advantage of the latest advances in technology, such as \#DigPINS,
   Virtually Connecting, collaborative annotation, and dual-pathway MOOCs.
   We then share a semi-fictional authoethnography of our (the authors')
   daily connected lives, and we end by highlighting elements of the models
   we shared that we feel could be adapted by institutions to achieve
   educator professional development that is more transformative,
   participatory, and equitable.},

Abstract = {The present study examined motivation toward English learning among
   students at an international school in Japan. The motivation of 112
   elementary school students, including those with English and Japanese as
   an L1, and those bilingual in English and Japanese, was analyzed based
   on self-determination theory. The results showed a distinction between
   intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, including three types of regulation
   (viz., identified, introjected, and external regulation) on the
   self-determination continuum. For all three language groups,
   self-determined orientations constituted the highest motivation for
   studying English, and English L1 participants were more enthusiastic
   than Japanese L1 participants about studying English. Whereas a number
   of studies have suggested that Japanese L1 students' motivation toward
   English learning decreases with grade level, this study found that
   participants' intrinsic motivation did not decrease significantly. This
   finding may be due to the immersion environment, in which Japanese L1
   participants learnt English together with English L1 participants, whose
   intrinsic motivation significantly increased from the middle to upper
   grades. It may also be due to the opportunity to use English with both
   L1 and L2 peers, allowing L2 learners to visualize target language use
   in the English-Japanese immersion environment.},

Abstract = {Personally engaged study strategies focused on deep-level learning,
   internal fascination with the subject with a sense of its relevance,
   accomplishment in mastering it, and a sense of calling to it
   characterize intrinsically motivated students. Intrinsic motivation can
   be long lasting and self-determined stemming from internal autonomy. On
   the other hand, making effort to foster students' intrinsic motivation
   can be slow with the need for a variety of approaches, special and
   lengthy preparations. However, previous findings show that increasing
   student success through instruction in self-determination (i.e.,
   autonomy) better motivate students to learn at all educational levels,
   including those with disabilities. The aim of this paper was to
   investigate the type of motivation leading students to pursue higher
   education, and to describe the adaptation of the modified version of the
   Academic Motivation Scale (AMS), developed by Vallerand et al. This
   seven-point Likert-scaled instrument was designed to assess
   self-determination continuum and the types of motivation with their
   regulatory styles. The sample consisted of 467 university students in
   regular classroom settings enrolled at a Czech university. In EFA a
   4-factor model was generated explaining 61\% of the total variance. In
   this version, the questionnaire consisted of 16 items with Cronbach's a
   ranging from. 82 to.60. The data proved a student's (F1) identified
   regulation, (F2) external regulation, (F3) amotivation, and (F4)
   intrinsic motivation to be strong predictors of students' motivation to
   pursue higher education. Furthermore, the relationship between gender,
   age, GPA, year and field of study was further identified.},

Abstract = {International students bring great cultural and economic value to
   universities in the United States, but they face unique challenges, the
   primary academic challenge concerns communication and participation in
   the classroom. Cultivating classroom environments that support
   international students' success requires the consideration of cultural,
   psychological, and motivational factors. Following an integrated
   framework of Self-Determination Theory (SDT: Ryan \& Deci, 2018) and
   Culturally Relevant/Responsive Pedagogy, Teaching and Education (CRPTE:
   Aronson \& Laughter, 2016; Gay, 2018; Ladson-Billings, 1995, 2014), we
   examined if international students' perceptions of autonomy supportive
   and culturally responsive environments predicted their general and
   intercultural willingness to communicate and oral participation through
   basic psychological needs, self-determined motivation, and communication
   anxiety in U.S. university classrooms. Data from 397 nonnative
   English-speaking and 113 native English-speaking international students
   from one institution were analyzed using structural equation modeling
   and path analysis. Results supported the significant roles of perceived
   autonomy supportive and culturally responsive environments in
   communication and participation outcomes. This study responds to a
   recent trend for motivation research to integrate cultural perspectives,
   addresses international students' needs in the era of active learning,
   and extends willingness to communicate research beyond the previous
   scope. We discuss theoretical, methodological, and practical
   implications for motivation research and teaching and learning in higher
   education.},

Abstract = {Since listening and speaking are two integral skills for effective
   second language (L2) communication, enhancing learners' motivation to
   listen to and speak in the target language will engage them in the
   learning process, eventually leading to improvements in these two
   skills. Yet despite its importance, L2 listening and speaking motivation
   is underexplored in the current literature. Drawing on
   self-determination theory, this study adapted, validated, and
   administered one L2 listening motivation scale and one L2 speaking
   motivation scale to 863 undergraduate students from different regions of
   China. Correlation analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and
   inferential statistical analyses (e.g., ANOVA) were used to compute the
   data. The results revealed that the learners were both intrinsically and
   extrinsically motivated to listen to and speak in English. A strong
   association between L2 listening motivation and speaking motivation was
   observed. Furthermore, gender, geographical, and disciplinary
   differences were found in the two kinds of motivation, and overseas
   experience also affected the learners' motivation. The results provide
   insights into L2 learner motivation in specific linguistic domains and
   yield pedagogical implications for L2 teaching and learning.},

Title = {Supporting pre-service teachers in developing research competence},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 13},
Abstract = {IntroductionTeachers need research competence to reflect on their
   teaching and to interpret and implement research-based recommendations.
   However, many pre-service teachers have critical attitudes toward
   research, little motivation to engage in research, and comparatively low
   knowledge of research methods and thereby consequently indicating a low
   research competence. Flexible online modules in university teaching
   could be a promising approach to address these issues. Online modules
   can potentially promote self-determined motivation, but should be
   sufficiently structured to support learners' need for competence.
   MethodsWe designed two learning environments with different types of
   structure: a non-restrictive structured environment and a restrictive
   structured environment. A total of N = 108 pre-service biology teachers
   were randomly assigned to the two learning environments. Results and
   discussionContrary to our assumption, the restrictive type of structure
   of the learning environment did not lead to a higher perception of
   competence. This might be a consequence of external pressure, for
   example, the examination at the end of the course. Regarding pre-service
   teachers' research competence, we found a decrease in the
   affective-motivational domain and an increase in the cognitive domain in
   both learning environments. These results suggest that fostering
   pre-service teachers' research competence should focus on the
   affective-motivational domain. In order to positively affect this
   domain, care must be taken to ensure that structuring elements are not
   experienced as control and that given choices are meaningful to
   students.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The role of teacher autonomy support (TAS) is central to
   students' engagement. However, there is a scarcity of empirical evidence
   on the mediating role of personal best (PB) goals between autonomy
   support and student engagement. Hence, in this research we examined the
   extent to which TAS could impact cognitive, behavioural and emotional
   engagement with the mediating role of PB goals among undergraduate
   students.
   Methodology - A cross-sectional research design was applied. A total of
   266 undergraduate students from a large government university located in
   northern Malaysia participated in this research. The Learning Climate
   Questionnaire (LCQ) and the Personal Best Scale were used to measure the
   students' perception of `FAS and their PB goals respectively, while the
   Engagement Versus Disaffection with Learning measurement scale and the
   Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire were used to collect data on
   cognitive, behavioural and emotional engagement. Structural Equation
   Modelling using AMOS 23 was adopted to test the hypothesized
   relationships.
   Findings - The results of the study support our postulated model,
   showing that TAS is related with student engagement aspects through the
   full mediating role of PB goals.
   Significance - These results augment the present understanding of the
   self-determination theory motivation mediation model by highlighting
   that creating a conducive learning environment that facilitates
   self-determined behaviours among students will nurture PB goals and
   enhance engagement, which will be beneficial for teaching and learning
   processes in education.},

Title = {Digital Environments of Education 4.0 and complex thinking:
   Communicative Literacy to close the digital gender gap},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-20},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The gender digital divide (GDD) is a social phenomenon that denies
   citizens access to technologies, the internet, and the services
   associated with Education 4.0. Reducing this gap requires communicative
   literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to
   create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual
   environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that
   focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological
   world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical
   principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which
   emphasize the use of technology, self -determined learning, and
   collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the
   participation of 124 Mexican students of technical -professional
   education. The study's objective was to analyze how they scaled their
   communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative
   experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in
   digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico.
   Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic
   thinking (z = -2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly
   higher mean ( M = 25.36) than men ( M = 25.11). Qualitative results
   support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as
   participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90\%).
   This suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively
   enhance communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they
   can be spaces where both women and men achieve similar levels of digital
   literacy.},

Title = {Examining early adolescents' motivation for physical education:
   associations with actual and perceived motor competence},
Journal = {PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {359-374},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Background:The dynamic nature of physical education (PE) requires
   careful consideration of lesson planning and delivery in order to
   promote health and wellbeing and to achieve various learning goals. One
   such goal is promoting personal and social development to support
   students to value and lead a healthy and active lifestyle, especially
   during transition into adolescence. In order to design learning
   environments that support students' engagement in PE, it is important to
   understand how outcomes such as motor competence (MC) influence
   motivation for PE. There are two approaches to understand MC, actual and
   perceived MC, and both have implications for healthy lifestyles in
   childhood and adolescence. Therefore, this study examined associations
   of actual and perceived MC with young adolescents' motivation for PE.
   Method:A sample of 236 students 11-14 years of age (M = 13.01,SD = .72)
   participated in the study. Assessments included actual MC
   (Korperkoordinations test for Kinder; KTK), perceived MC
   (self-administered form of the pictorial scale of Perceived Movement
   Skill Competence; PMSC) and motivation for PE (Perceived Locus of
   Causality Scale; PLOC). Polynomial regression with Response Surface
   Analyses were conducted to examine the influence of actual and perceived
   MC on motivation for PE. Findings:The results showed weak-to-moderate
   positive associations of actual and perceived MC with students'
   motivation for PE. Perceived MC explained about 12\% of the variance of
   student's self-determined motivation towards PE. This effect was larger
   in students with lower levels of perceived MC compared to students with
   higher levels of perceived MC. Discussion:Taking into account that both
   actual and perceived MC are synergistically related but only perceived
   MC explains self-determined motivation, our results suggest that
   perceived MC is an important factor to consider when attempting to
   promote an active and healthy lifestyle. Using the developmental model
   of motor competence {[}Stodden et al.2008. ``A Developmental Perspective
   on the Role of Motor Skill Competence in Physical Activity: An Emergent
   Relationship.{''}Quest60 (2): 290-306] and self-determination theory
   {[}Deci and Ryan2000. ``The ``What{''} and ``Why{''} of Goal Pursuits:
   Human Needs and the Self-Determination of Behavior.{''}Psychological
   Inquiry11 (4): 227-268. doi:10.1207/S15327965PLI1104\_01], we discuss
   the findings in relation to the importance of considering perceived MC
   as an explicit outcome in the PE curriculum. Conclusion:During early
   adolescence, PE programs should not only focus on teaching movement
   skills but also fostering perceived MC in order to promote motivation
   for PE, especially among students with lower levels of self-perception.
   For this, pedagogical approaches such as need supportive teaching
   derived from self-determination theory can be used to help students
   become competent, confident and motivated movers.},

Title = {Effect of a hybrid teaching games for understanding/sport education unit
   on elementary students' self-determined motivation in physical education},
Journal = {EUROPEAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {As an alternative to the direct instructional model, Metzler proposed a
   range of pedagogical models that include second generation models such
   as teaching games for understanding (TGfU) and sport education (SE).
   These pedagogical models have key design features that can promote high
   levels of autonomous motivation for both boys and girls. Consequently,
   the purpose of this study was to investigate the motivational outcomes
   of elementary boys and girls as they participated in an invasion game
   unit through two pedagogical models: a hybrid TGfU/SE unit or a direct
   instruction unit. Participants were 292 elementary school students (mean
   age = 10.41, standard deviation age = 0.49), who were taught through a
   hybrid TGfU/SE unit or a more traditional teacher-centred format within
   a pre-intervention/post-intervention quasi-experimental design. The
   hybrid unit was designed according to the characteristics of SE, while
   learning tasks were designed to integrate the pedagogical principles of
   TGfU. A 2 (pedagogical model) x 2 (test-time) x 2 (gender) multivariate
   analysis of variance was performed to detect between-groups and
   within-group differences. Significant differences in student motivation
   were observed for both boys and girls who participated in the hybrid
   TGfU/SE unit in both analyses across all motivational outcomes. Despite
   the existence of social stereotypes in terms of physical activity,
   teachers' use of hybrid TGfU/SE units promotes an autonomy-supportive,
   inclusive, and equitable learning environment where all students,
   regardless of their gender and/or content focus of the unit and have
   opportunities to increase their engagement, enjoyment, and social
   interactions within physical education lessons.},

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Knowledge about student motivation allows educators to
   broaden their understanding and to establish strategies that make it
   possible to enhance motivation.
   OBJECTIVES. To investigate the levels of student motivation at different
   phases of medical education, comparing incoming students' motivation
   with that of those at the end of their studies, as well as during the
   different preclinical, clinical, and clerkship cycles.
   METHOD: Cross-sectional study including students from a Brazilian public
   university. The questionnaire included sociodemographic data and the
   Academic Motivation Scale (AMS). Student motivation was compared at
   different phases of the medical course.
   RESULTS: 710 students were included. Students in the preclinical phase
   (1st-2nd years) had higher levels of integrated regulation AMS (e.g.,
   ``Education is a privilege.{''}), introjected regulation AMS (e.g.{''}I
   come because it is what is expected of me.{''}), and intrinsic
   motivation AMS (e.g.{''}School is a pleasure{''}). Students in the
   clinical phase (3rd-4th years) had higher levels of amotivation (e.g.,
   ``I'm wasting my time at school.{''}) and external regulation AMS (e.g.,
   ``I'm coming to school to earn a degree{''}). AMS levels of external
   regulation, introjected relation, and integrated regulation were
   different for Clerkship students (5th-6th years) compared to preclinical
   students, but not for clinical students. Comparing only the first and
   last years, incoming students had higher levels of integrated regulation
   AMS and lower levels of amotivation AMS and external regulation AMS.
   CONCLUSION: Important motivational changes were found during different
   phases of medical school, with higher levels of motivation during the
   course's initial semesters. These findings can aid in developing
   educational strategies to stimulate self-determined education.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {BackgroundArt-of-living describes a mindful and self-determined way of
   dealing with one's self and way of life. It is related to measures of
   well-being. Art-of-living is based on strategies and attitudes which can
   be learned and therefore can be changed. Two types of training for
   students to increase art-of-living were developed and tested in two
   studies to determine the effects on art-of-living measures.
   MethodsStudy 1 dealt with the initial examination of whether it is
   possible to enhance the art-of-living by training selected art-of-living
   strategies. Therefore, training with three conditions was developed and
   conducted with secondary school students (ages 16-19). In Study 2, a
   second art-of-living training was developed and conducted with children
   from primary school (ages 8-11).
   ResultsIn Study 1, the art-of-living measures increased significantly
   for the training conditions compared to a control group. In addition,
   Study 2 showed that higher levels of the art-of-living lead to a better
   quality of life.
   ConclusionsIn summary, the training successfully enhanced art-of-living.
   Limitations on and benefits of utilising the art-of-living training are
   discussed.},

Title = {LEARNING ABOUT OWLS AND THEIR CONSERVATION - A COMPARISON OF
   MEDIA-ASSISTED INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS},
Journal = {PROBLEMS OF EDUCATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {1},
Pages = {95-105},
Abstract = {In this study, two short-term educational treatments for secondary
   school dealing with ecology and conservation of European owl species
   were compared under realistic field-conditions. Both motivating learning
   environments, a play-like activity (quartet) and a hypermedia website
   tool for two lessons (90 min), are known to provide a strong ``Hawthorne
   effect{''}, which might useful for achievement in a short-term learning
   unit in Science Education. Information units were similar, only the
   structure of presentation differed within both treatments. Objectives of
   the study were (i) a comparison of both teaching methods concerning the
   cognitive learning outcome and (ii) motivational variables in a
   pre-/post- and retention-test design with control group. Pupils were
   randomly assigned one treatment (Hypermedia: N = 34, quartet: N = 30,
   control: N = 28). As result of multivariate statistics, a significant
   higher achievement in the computer-aided group was assessed immediately
   after the lesson, while the retention test did not produce significant
   differences between the treatments. Pupils performed significantly
   better in the retention-test compared to the post-test, which might be
   due to a short teaching sequence of ten minutes after the post-test. The
   motivational variables measured with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory
   (Ryan, Connell \& Plant, 1990) didn't show any difference between the
   two treatments, suggesting that both treatments are motivating and that
   the Hawthorne effect might be similar. Pooling both experimental groups,
   a significant positive relationship between interest/enjoyment and
   post-test scores and between effort and retention and a negative
   correlation between retention test and the perceived pressure can be
   reported.
   A consequence for Science Education practice is the usefulness of both
   treatments for successful and motivating achievement as well as the
   fact, that the hypermedia approach can be used for self-determined
   learning as out-of-school-preparation. Furthermore, research concerning
   the short concluding teaching sequences is necessary.},

Title = {Stability and change of secondary school students' motivation profiles
   in mathematics: Effects of a student intervention},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {100},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There is high agreement that motivation is an important factor for
   successful learning processes and outcomes. But how do students differ
   in terms of motivation and how do these differences affect the
   effectiveness of a motivation intervention? As an intervention interacts
   with students' characteristics, students' heterogeneity must be
   considered and homogeneous intervention effects must be critically
   examined. This study aimed to identify motivation profiles of a
   specifically vulnerable student group, namely students in the lowest
   ability tier in the learning of mathematics. Within the framework of
   self-determination theory, we investigated how these profiles changed
   during Grade 7 and Grade 8. Furthermore, the study examined whether a
   particular intervention setting aimed at promoting positive emotions and
   motivation in learning had an impact on the patterns of change in the
   specific motivation profiles compared to students in the control
   condition. A latent profile analysis based on self-reported intrinsic,
   identified, introjected, and external regulation of 348 students
   revealed three motivation profiles, consisting of (a) low mixed, (b)
   high-mixed, and (c) self-determined. Results of the latent transition
   analysis indicated that the majority of students tended to remain in the
   same profile and also revealed different effects of the intervention on
   different motivation profiles. The intervention seemed to be better
   tailored to students in the low-mixed motivation profile than to
   students in other profiles. This result highlights the nature of
   differential effects between students.},

Abstract = {The article reports on the development of a questionnaire that can be
   used to assess learner participation opportunities from the perspective
   of students and teachers. The factor-analytical tests are based on data
   from students (n(1) = 314) and teachers (n(2) = 97) of the lower and
   upper secondary level. For the two perspectives as well as for different
   fields of learner-side possibilities of influence, the following
   three-factorial scale structure can be empirically verified consistently
   in each case: (1) self-determined participation, (2) conditional
   co-determination and (3) external determination. The analyses indicate
   appropriate model fit parameters and overall scale reliabilities. From a
   descriptive point of view, the data show patterns that are in line with
   expectations: (a) the surveyed students consistently gave higher
   approval ratings to the teacher's external determination than to the two
   forms of participatory influence; (b) the level of participation
   opportunities perceived by the learners varies between the different
   areas of instruction; (c) teachers rated the learner's opportunities for
   influence significantly higher than the learners themselves do. The
   presented instrument offers the possibility to empirically assess and
   investigate learner participation opportunities in a differentiated way.},

Title = {Lessons to learn, discourses to change, relationships to build: How
   Decolonising Race Theory can articulate the interface between school
   leadership and Aboriginal students' schooling experiences},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {When conversations about Aboriginal student educational success emerge,
   they are usually focussed on the high levels of underachievement and
   disengagement. School leadership is seen as critical to contributing to
   student outcomes. For Aboriginal students, creating inclusive learning
   environments that support culture and identity, and building trusting
   relationships with families and community members are also critical
   goals. As part of the Aboriginal Voices project, this paper uses
   Decolonising Race Theory (Moodie, 2018) to analyse interviews with four
   Principals in urban, regional, and rural locations to understand their
   perceptions and experiences of leading Aboriginal education in schools.
   From the interviews, three key themes emerged: leading culture, identity
   and school-community relationships, leading curriculum, pedagogy and
   teacher development, and leading student participation and achievement.
   Decolonising Race Theory (Moodie, 2018) is applied as an analytical tool
   to view these themes through a critical Indigenous lens to understand
   the Principals' discourses around Aboriginal student experiences at
   school and their role in improving outcomes. This revealed contradictory
   positionings within and between Principal comments, from blaming
   students and their families for their underachievement, to implementing
   cultural programmes to build confidence to become self-determining
   adults. This data provides new ways of thinking through discourses about
   Aboriginal students and their families, communities, schools, teachers
   and Principals, and challenges some of the `regimes of truth' that
   position these groups in particular ways.},

Title = {Generating metadata to study and teach about African issues},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& PEOPLE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {341-365},
Abstract = {Purpose - After almost three centuries of employing western educational
   approaches, many African societies are still characterized by low
   western literacy rates, civil conflicts, and underdevelopment. It is
   obvious that these western educational paradigms, which are not
   indigenous to Africans, have done relatively little good for Africans.
   Thus, the purpose of this paper is to argue that the salvation for
   Africans hinges upon employing indigenous African educational paradigms
   which can be subsumed under the rubric of ubuntugogy, which the authors
   define as the art and science of teaching and learning undergirded by
   humanity toward others.
   Design/methodology/approach - Therefore, ubuntugogy transcends pedagogy
   (the art and science of teaching), andragogy (the art and science of
   helping adults learn), ergonagy (the art and science of helping people
   learn to work), and heutagogy (the study of self-determined learning).
   That many great African minds, realizing the debilitating effects of the
   western educational systems that have been forced upon Africans, have
   called for different approaches.
   Findings - One of the biggest challenges for studying and teaching about
   Africa in Africa at the higher education level, however, is the paucity
   of published material. Automated generation of metadata is one way of
   mining massive data sets to compensate for this shortcoming.
   Originality/value - Thus, the authors address the following major
   research question in this paper: What is automated generation of
   metadata and how can the technique be employed from an African-centered
   perspective? After addressing this question, conclusions and
   recommendations are offered.},

Abstract = {The pursuit of learning in high school generally draws on multiple
   sources of motivation that could be affected by learning contexts and
   cultural values about education. We conducted this study to capture the
   complex interplay between various motivational regulation strategies
   across countries. Our goal was threefold: (1) to identify
   high-schoolers' motivation profiles using the seven types of regulation
   strategies proposed by the Self-Determination Theory; (2) to investigate
   the role of parenting practices and youth's mental health in predicting
   profile membership, and (3) to investigate whether motivation profiles
   and their associated predictors are replicated across two cross-national
   samples (435 Canadian and 414 Belgian adolescents), and across two
   consecutive school years. Participants completed self-report
   questionnaires at two time points over one year. Latent profile analysis
   revealed three school motivation profiles that differ on quantity and
   quality of motivation: high quantity (highest intrinsic and extrinsic,
   lowest amotivation), moderately motivated (moderate intrinsic, high
   extrinsic, low amotivation) and poor quality (lowest intrinsic,
   moderately high extrinsic, highest amotivation). High levels of positive
   parenting practices (need support, warmth, monitoring) and low levels of
   externalizing behaviors predicted increased likelihood of membership in
   the high quantity than in the other two motivation profiles. The
   structure of the three profiles and the relationships between predictors
   and profile membership were generally replicated across the two samples
   and the two school years. The generalizability of our three-profile
   solution and the importance of a positive family environment and mental
   health in the development of school motivation in adolescence are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {While many of us were brought up with the admonition by our parents to,
   ``Do as I say, not as I do,{''} this, in actuality, does not constitute
   effective teaching. Instructors in higher education, however, are often
   guilty of providing excellent resources and discourse on effective
   teaching but fall back on old habits when are teaching that are in
   conflict with what they have instructed. Confusion ensues. The HUCC
   Model for Teachng provides instructors with a map for including the
   following components for effective teaching: Heutagogy or
   self-determined learning. Rather than using a single-loop model of
   learning in which the learner identifies a problem, takes action,
   produces an outcome, and then begins again with a new problem,
   double-loop learning encourages students to reflect on their learning
   and to assess how it has changed their beliefs and actions and how they
   can apply what they have learned to other areas. Teachers become
   facilitators, not as leaders who sit back and let the students
   ``discover{''} their learning but as leaders who provide appropriate
   guidance, resources, and models. Universal design for learning (UDL).
   This encompasses the idea of the architectural term, universal design,
   in which products that may have been designed for a certain population
   may, in the long run, be a design that is used by a diverse population.
   UDL uses this same theory as applied to education. We need to provide
   not only equal access to materials but equal access to learning.
   Creative thinking and problem solving. The move from the Information Age
   to what Pink (2006) refers to as the Conceptual Age calls for learning
   that engages students in deeper understanding of how to think through
   problems and produce solutions. Collaboration. Using Clark's tenets for
   teamwork as a basis for using the above theories in ways that students
   become accountable, effective team members. By encompassing all four
   components, instructors can model inclusive, reflective teaching that
   will provide students with skills that fit into the 21st century's needs
   for education.},

Abstract = {Despite educational policies that have promoted multilingualism in
   schools, the English language proficiency levels of young Spanish people
   are still below those of OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
   Development) member countries. This is despite the appearance of
   multiple studies that have addressed communicative competence and its
   intentionality from a positive perspective. However, there are hardly
   any studies that analyze the problems or blockages that may be causing
   the lack of communicative skills and competences of our young people.
   Therefore, the aim of the present study is to analyze the correlation
   between psychological needs frustration with embarrassment, anxiety and
   hopelessness, motivation and communicative intentionality in English.
   The sample of participants is 786 high school students. The analyses
   employed are reliability analysis, mean, standard deviation, bivariate
   correlations and a structural equation model. The results showed that
   frustration of psychological needs positively predicted anxiety,
   embarrassment and hopelessness, and in turn, each of these emotions
   negatively predicted motivation and communicative intention. However,
   motivation positively predicted communicative intention. These findings
   provide insight into students' English language failure and could
   support the use of classroom interventions, such as gamification, and
   teaching strategies, such as game-based learning, that strengthen
   students' confidence in using English both in the classroom and in other
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Background: in the school stage, adolescents experience different
   emotional and motivational states involved in the learning process that
   play a fundamental role in their personal and academic development. In
   this way, the study focuses on analyzing the relationships between
   emotional regulation, self-efficacy and academic performance, as well as
   the possible mediating role of self-efficacy in both. Methods: the study
   included 2204 students, both male (N = 1193; 54.12\%) and female (N =
   1011; 45.87\%) with ages ranging from 12 to 18 years (M = 14.69; DT =
   1.76). The measures used for the investigation were the Emotion
   Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), the Academic Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES)
   and average marks were used to measure students' academic performance.
   Results: The results of the study revealed a self-determined behavioral
   pattern characterized by high scores in emotional regulation,
   self-efficacy and academic performance. Likewise, the mediating role of
   self-efficacy between emotional regulation and student academic
   performance was significant. Conclusion: the influence of the academic
   self-efficacy variable as a mediator between the studied constructs is
   denoted, as well as the importance of promoting adaptive behaviors in
   the classroom that can lead to adequate personal development of students
   together with optimal academic performance.},

Abstract = {Under a global scenario of constant changes and uncertainty, of
   technological immersiveness, that permeates every aspect of life,
   traditional education models, supported by fixed, transmission-mode,
   teacher-centered pedagogies cannot solely fulfill the demands of the
   professional or academic settings. It is indispensable to study new
   models of learning, as well as more beneficial forms of using
   technological environments, tools, resources to implement a learning
   experience based on collaboratives, on knowledge construction and
   sharing, on alternative, contextualized and valid ways of assessment.
   It is also necessary to rethink learning in fashion design since it
   requires constant development and renewal of competencies to meet the
   rapid changes of the professional landscape, as well as the individual
   needs. Fashion design presupposes, like any design process, a learning
   capability, since it starts (or restarts) every season, every cycle,
   with the recognition of a problem: the need or the desire for what is
   new, cultivated by the taste for innovation, creativity, different,
   unknown. So, in order to keep updated, fashion designers form a sort of
   `learning community', usually in online environments, around fashion
   information, ideas, resources, experiences, that are transmitted,
   shared, fed, promoted, redesigned, recreated or even admittedly copied.
   For this reason, it seemed necessary to examine alternative
   possibilities that foster collaborative online learning in fashion
   design.
   Part of broader research about fashion design in higher education
   contexts, this study presents a model for a fashion design collaborative
   online course structured on previously studied set of principles, and
   reinforced by Heutagogy, as the primary theoretical approach that
   emphasizes collaborative, contextualized, connected, constructive,
   lifelong, self-determining learning experiences.
   Although there is some debate whether learning in fashion design can
   happen in online environments, the main focus of this study was to
   establish a model for a fashion design collaborative online course based
   on a coherent theoretical structure, able to guide content, resource,
   delivery, assessment choices and to guarantee the learning quality. The
   model presented in this study is expected to enhance learning as a
   process, starting with interactions around a design problem and
   potentially evolving to form a learning community, virtually connected
   beyond the physical classrooms or the physical frontiers, stimulating
   innovative, meaningful and contextualized fashion design ideas and
   solutions.},

Abstract = {UK Higher Education (HE) changes are driven by political impetus,
   social, economic and technological forces to bring about a
   highly-skilled workforce. Healthcare education in particular benefits
   from the adoption of new innovative ways to learn how to manage
   patient-centred integrated care. The balance of simultaneous skill and
   knowledge acquisition, such as in Healthcare, renders independent
   digital learning an attractive proposition for Higher Education
   Institutions (HEls) and the National Health Service (NHS). Application
   of digital technology to support learning increases flexibility and
   accessibility, but raises other issues. Lack of Information,
   Communication and Technological (ICT) expertise among learners,
   insufficient or unreliable internet access, equipment failure, software
   compatibility, staff confidence in digital education and above all, a
   contemporary pedagogy harnessing the combined HE-Society experiences.
   This paper describes a socially immersive learning (SIL) pedagogy as a
   departure from existing ways of being. It has arisen because of a range
   of factors that have caused a more fluid and fragmented political,
   economic and social landscape affording individuals to develop a new
   skill set of connectivity and collaboration as their self-determined
   learning needs dictate. Decision-making processes are important, as many
   HEIs currently pay scant attention to teaching students `how to learn'
   within a particular pedagogy such as e-learning, Technology Enhanced
   Learning, Technology Enabled Learning, with the expectation that
   students will seamlessly adapt to a different mode of learning. HEI
   systems are predominately designed for on-campus students; hence
   information relates to location thus raising identity issues for the
   online learner. Systems thinking overlooks the lived experience of
   online teaching, and the time investment required. E-learning is often
   perceived as `geographically remote' and that the spatial remoteness of
   the tutor renders the relationship more distant, thereby overlooking the
   strong relational aspects that can exist in e-learning and online
   communities.
   In an increasingly connected world in which the graduates of the future
   will be required to work across disciplines on inter-connected
   collective `wicked' problems. Silo working in university departments
   must become permeable to enable collaboration, networking and collective
   decision making. These changes, accompanied by the rise in degree
   apprenticeships which relocate elements of learning off-campus and into
   the workplace and social spaces, present challenges and openings to
   create student-centric engagement, enhance student experience and new
   learning opportunities in contemporary higher education.
   The implications of this development are to move beyond education design
   that aligns to preconceived notions of how individuals learn in
   prescribed places and using existing familiar methods (curriculum,
   schemes of work, defined learning content, defined learning outcomes) to
   the changing role and identity of the teacher, learner and contexts and
   collaboration where learning occurs. This new approach has the potential
   to become a keystone in a social movement that readily crosses,
   physical, social, economic and political boundaries to develop learning
   and translate that into ways of impacting on society as a global
   citizen.},

Title = {Impact of guided self-study on learning success in undergraduate
   physiotherapy students in Switzerland - a feasibility study of a higher
   education intervention},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Background: Guided self-study (G-SS) can be used as a self-directed
   learning method or self-determined learning that fosters changes in
   knowledge and skills in a higher physiotherapy education setting. Until
   now, there has been no empirical evidence for the use of G-SS in higher
   physiotherapy education. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility
   to establish a G-SS program in a fulltime undergraduate physiotherapy
   degree course. In addition, the effectiveness of the G-SS was assessed
   on changes in knowledge and skills.
   Method: Fifty-one first-semester physiotherapy students were randomly
   divided into a G-SS group or control group (CG). The G-SS group received
   six clinical cases. Each case was processed in an eight-day cycle. One
   week in advance, the clinical case were provided to the students
   electronically (day 1). The students prepared the cases in groups and
   were guided by the tutor during this preparation time (day 2 to 7).
   Group work results were presented and reflected on during a moderated
   plenum session at day 8. A priori criteria of success were defined based
   on empirical experience for the primary outcome parameters i) exposure,
   ii) responsiveness of students and iii) program differentiation. The
   secondary outcome was the total score in the objective structured
   clinical examination (OSCE) and written exams. Statistical analyses were
   conducted using SPSS.
   Results: The responsiveness of students as willing to participate in the
   G-SS program was 23\%, clearly below the a priori set 83\%. No
   differences in program differentiation were found. G-SS as compared to
   the CG scored significantly better on OSCE (p = 0.003) and on the
   written exam (p = 0.004).
   Conclusion: The results showed that this higher education G-SS program
   in its current form was not feasible. Slight modification of the study
   protocol (e.g. better time planning in the academic calendar) is needed
   to improve the student's responsiveness. The adjustments to the
   timetable must allow the physiotherapy students to prepare the clinical
   cases under conditions of lower workload. G-SS has the potential to
   promote change in knowledge and skills in undergraduate physiotherapy
   students when students prepare and present the clinical case solutions
   and reflect upon their actions.},

Abstract = {In the light of rapid social change in an increasingly complex world, it
   is widely recognised that graduates need more than academic attainment
   in order to transform such challenges into opportunities for change.
   They need to develop the entrepreneurial skills that enable them to
   seize and exploit opportunities, and make a difference in their
   communities. Higher education institutions are important agents of
   economic and social growth (Herrmann et. al., 2008). Whilst there is
   pressure within higher education institutions to promote the,enterprise
   culture', there is no substantive measure of agreement in literature as
   to what. the appropriate pedagogical approaches should be that would
   encourage student enterprise and graduate entrepreneurship (Gibb, 2002,
   2006). The promotion and evaluation of entrepreneurial learning is an
   acknowledged area of weakness in entrepreneurship education. A typical
   University setting is not conducive to entrepreneurial learning as
   traditional learning and assessment methods - e.g. lecture, examination
   etc. - do not promote entrepreneurship, whereas entrepreneurship
   education requires students to develop new ways of thinking and new
   modes of behaviour (Heinonen and Poikkijoki, 2006). This calls for
   pedagogical approaches that encourage `learning by doing' and provide
   opportunities for students to proactively manage their learning. One
   such approach is enquiry-based learning, in which students are expected
   to construct their own knowledge and understandings by engaging in
   supported processes of open enquiries (Kahn and Rourke, 2008). Based on
   a case study of 80 students in a marketing innovation module of a
   Masters programme, this paper aims to explore how effective the
   enquiry-based learning approach is in promoting and evaluating
   entrepreneurial learning. The research emphasises on the entrepreneurial
   process and innovation - i.e. the processes involved in developing
   market innovations rather than new venture creation. The assessment is
   an integral element to facilitate and drive student learning.
   Enquiry-based approaches where students engage in an essentially
   self-determined process of enquiry (Hutchings, 2005; Savin-Baden, 2007)
   together with their integrated assessment strategies empower learners to
   take more responsibility for their own learning thereby increasing their
   engagement in the learning process (Bandura, 1977; Feuerstein, 1991).
   The production of a learning portfolio in the form of learning logs was
   an integral part of the module's assessment, and these learning logs
   provided important information about their learning as well as about the
   student's approach to managing that learning process. The data used in
   this study analyses written student reflections of management learning
   and knowledge application between 60008000 words. This paper seeks to
   evaluate the effectiveness of such an approach in enhancing
   entrepreneurial learning. It concludes by drawing upon the implications
   on curriculum planning, assessment design and feedback strategy.},

Abstract = {This paper summarizes the experience of training foreign students at the
   pre-university courses using the technology of the activity-based
   teaching method as a special didactic system. The object of the study is
   foreign students entering the engineering majors of the university after
   graduating from the pre-university courses. To activate the process of
   teaching the future studying foreign language, as well as teaching
   introductory core subjects (for the further studying on bachelor and
   master degree programs), teachers of the pre-university courses began to
   actively use activity-based teaching methods. The essence of
   activity-based teaching method is that the student becomes a subject of
   activity and doesn't receive knowledge from others, but develop it by
   himself in the process of his own educational and cognitive activity. At
   the same time, he learns to self-determine, to be involved in learning
   process, to solve arising difficulties, to make independent discoveries,
   to analyze and evaluate his activities by himself. The implementation of
   our project has demonstrated that using of activity-based methods and
   technologies made it possible to develop a cognitive motivation of
   foreign students to learn foreign language, including for the future
   professional communication and further studying on bachelor degree
   programs. As a research and practical experience have shown, the
   activity-based method forms and develops the necessary components of
   students' personal development and readiness to study on the higher
   education programs: creativity (creative abilities); critical, divergent
   and productive thinking; research skills; social intelligence, etc.
   After graduating the pre-university courses, students show independence
   in the knowledge development, activity and interest in learning
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Investment in higher education facilities in terms of both hardware and
   software has witnessed significant growth on a yearly basis since the
   reintroduction of the college entrance examination known as the NMT in
   1977. However, a social assessment of graduates' qualities seems to
   indicate that the improvement in skill levels and graduates' general
   qualities has failed to keep pace with the growth in investment. As a
   bridge to relate college environment to student gains in learning,
   student self-determined involvement in educational activities plays an
   important role in analyzing the educational effects of colleges. Based
   on a conducted through the survey of Chinese College Student Experience
   Questionnaire, with data collected from 647 valid respondents,
   universities can observe and evaluate the levels and quality of
   students' involvement in the educational process. The students'
   involvement of educational activities can be investigated through data
   analysis, employing statistical methods of a structural equation model.
   In observing student involvement in the educational system, it becomes
   apparent that the students' capacity for building on and playing a key
   role in the improvement of the quality of education they receive is
   largely controlled by their involvement activities in the learning
   process. In addition, both of the college environment and student
   motivation have a combined and significant effect on student involvement
   behaviors. Student involvement can be divided into three gradual but
   distinct levels (controlled, identified and integrated involvement) in
   accordance with the varying degrees of internalization. Student
   involvement will exponentially magnify the positive effects on student
   gains when colleges invest in new and additional resources, particularly
   when students become more deeply involved in the educational
   environment. In addition, when colleges make a concentrated effort to
   recognize the importance of student involvement, and they encourage and
   incentivise students to become involved, the college itself will benefit
   greatly from the improved university environment. This combination of
   mutually beneficial activity, therefore, represents a virtuous circle of
   promotion between college and students.},

Title = {Increasing students' physical activity during school physical education:
   rationale and protocol for the SELF-FIT cluster randomized controlled
   trial},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {Background: The Self-determined Exercise and Learning For FITness
   (SELF-FIT) is a multi-component school-based intervention based on
   tenets of self-determination theory. SELF-FIT aims to increase students'
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during physical education
   lessons, and enhance their autonomous motivation towards fitness
   activities. Using a cluster randomized controlled trial, we aim to
   examine the effects of the intervention on students' MVPA during school
   physical education.
   Methods: Secondary 2 students (approximately aged 14 years) from 26
   classes in 26 different schools will be recruited. After baseline
   assessments, students will be randomized into either the experimental
   group or wait-list control group using a matched-pair randomization.
   Teachers allocated to the experimental group will attend two half-day
   workshops and deliver the SELF-FIT intervention for 8 weeks. The main
   intervention components include training teachers to teach in more need
   supportive ways, and conducting fitness exercises using a fitness dice
   with interchangeable faces. Other motivational components, such as
   playing music during classes, are also included. The primary outcome of
   the trial is students' MVPA during PE lessons. Secondary outcomes
   include students' leisure-time MVPA, perceived need support from
   teachers, need satisfaction, autonomous motivation towards physical
   education, intention to engage in physical activity, psychological
   well-being, and health-related fitness (cardiorespiratory and muscular
   fitness). Quantitative data will be analyzed using multilevel modeling
   approaches. Focus group interviews will also be conducted to assess
   students' perceptions of the intervention.
   Discussion: The SELF-FIT intervention has been designed to improve
   students' health and well-being by using high-intensity activities in
   classes delivered by teachers who have been tr ained to be autonomy
   needs supportive. If successful, scalable interventions based on
   SELF-FIT could be applied in physical education at large.},

Title = {Exploring sensitive boundaries in nursing education: Attitudes of
   undergraduate student nurses providing intimate care to patients},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {317-322},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Nursing students often feel challenged and intimidated to
   provide intimate care to patients in the health care setting. Student
   nurses in particular are faced with social, professional, academic and
   peer expectations and experience high levels of stress when providing
   this intimate care.
   Objective: Explore student nurses attitudes to providing intimate care.
   Methods: Year two and year three students of a three year undergraduate
   nursing programme completed a descriptive Nursing Students Intimate Care
   (NSIC) survey with open ended questions. This study discusses student
   responses to the question: Did you feel it was appropriate for a nurse
   to provide intimate care to a patient of the opposite sex?
   Results: Three major themes were identified: societal and
   self-determined role expectations, comfort and discomfort providing
   intimate care, and age and gender of the carer and recipient.
   Conclusions: Student nurses face numerous challenges when having to
   provide intimate care to patients. These challenges are influenced by
   the age, gender, levels of comfort of the nurse and the patient and is
   related to the nature of intimate care being provided. Student nurses
   will benefit from pre-clinical simulated training experiences in
   providing intimate care. This training needs to specifically consider
   being sensitive to the needs of the patient, maintaining patient
   dignity, negotiating, accommodating and implementing plan of care while
   being competent and professional in their approach to providing intimate
   care. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {HEUTAGOGICAL PRINCIPLES FOR FASHION DESIGN HIGHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {In a globally interconnected, technological, increasingly ubiquitous
   context, fashion designers need to convert prospective information into
   meaningful, current and validated content that companies and
   professionals may quickly access and integrate into their practice.
   Fashion design thrives in multicultural, hyperconnected settings, where
   learning happens as new projects are being developed. Fashion design
   cannot be fostered within a rigid environment (professional or
   educational), that do not promote, constantly and permanently,
   experiences and knowledge exchanges. So, what kind of learning would
   foster autonomous, prospective, meaningful experiences in fashion
   design? What principles would be necessary to frame such kind of
   learning?
   This paper is part of a broader research about fashion design in higher
   education contexts, especially those offered online (distance learning)
   under a lifelong learning perspective, and for that reason it keeps
   certain premises that guided the study.
   Firstly, it is this paper perspective that, similarly to what happens in
   fashion design development in professional scenarios, fashion design
   education should prompt opportunities of contextualized collaboration
   among learners, that come from multiple backgrounds, without the
   limitation of time and space. Next, in order to establish a lifelong,
   collaborative and creative experience, a greater fluidity would be
   expected between the learning / professional environments, allowing the
   learner / professional to travel in both ways, at different moments of
   their lives, and the acquired knowledge (professionally or academically)
   would be properly recognized. It is not the purpose of this paper to
   advocate that this fluidity can be better achieved by either online,
   onsite, blended or mobile supported learning systems. This leads to the
   final premise. Although it seems important to deeply acknowledge and
   study the technological possibilities for learning, simply propose a new
   delivery method is not enough. A meaningful learning experience should
   contemplate fashion design specificities, meet different professional
   needs, be prepared for the demands and impermanence of the sector, and
   create broader learning opportunities. Therefore, in order to accomplish
   that, a valid set of principles must be firstly established, and this is
   the main purpose of this paper.
   One of the most important aspects of this study was to examine a
   theoretical perspective that could ground fashion design education, and
   in doing so, contemplated fashion as a complex, cross disciplinary
   phenomenon, that presents specificities (a global system of massive
   production and acceptance of clothes and styles for a certain period of
   time, which entails highly expected and constant demand for innovation
   and creativity, originality and prospective information) that needed to
   be contemplated when establishing a set of learning principles. After an
   exploratory study carried out on existing researches about fashion
   design education, a set of learning principles were structured under the
   Heutagogy approach, considered in this paper a promising theory, since
   it sustains a student-centred, self-determined, double-loop lifelong
   learning perspective. Finally, those principles were used to analyse
   previously selected fashion design higher education programs, offered
   online and recommendations are presented.},

Title = {Impact of a sustained Cooperative Learning intervention on student
   motivation},
Journal = {PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-105},

Abstract = {Background: Cooperative Learning has been recently defined as a true
   pedagogical model. Moreover, in a recent review Casey and Goodyear
   reported that it can help physical education promote the four basic
   learning outcomes: physical, cognitive, social and affective.Purpose:
   The main goal was to investigate the impact of a sustained Cooperative
   Learning intervention on student motivation. The second goal was to
   assess students' perceptions of the Cooperative Learning class climate.
   Finally, the third goal was to explore students' feelings and thoughts
   after experiencing Cooperative Learning in physical education for an
   extended period of time.Participants and settings: 249 students (grades
   8-11) and 4 teachers enrolled in 4 different high schools agreed to
   participate. Each school administration allocated several class groups
   to each teacher based on its necessities. Therefore, intact physical
   education classes played a part in this research project. They were
   randomly distributed into an experimental group with 137 students (mean
   age 13.911.76 years), which experienced 3 consecutive cooperative
   learning units, and a comparison group with 112 students (mean age
   13.411.25 years), which experienced a traditional teaching approach
   during the same length of time.Research design: A pre-test, post-test,
   quasi-experimental, comparison group design was followed.Data
   collection: Prior to and at the end of the intervention programme, all
   participating students were asked to complete a questionnaire, which
   included the Perceived Locus of Causality Scale and the subscale
   Cooperative Learning' of the Perceived Motivational Climate
   Questionnaire. At post-test, participants in the experimental group were
   also asked to: Describe your feelings, your thoughts and your ideas on
   the three Cooperative Learning units that you just experienced in
   physical education'.Data analysis: Quantitative data was analysed using
   SPSS 22.0, while MAXQDA 11 was used to assist with qualitative data
   management.Findings: Quantitative data showed an increase in intrinsic
   motivation and identified regulation only in the experimental group.
   This group also increased its perceptions of a Cooperative Learning
   class climate. Qualitative data analysis of the students' responses
   after experiencing Cooperative Learning on a sustained basis produced
   five major themes: cooperation, relatedness, enjoyment, novelty and
   disappointment. All these findings are in line with Vallerand's
   hierarchical model of motivation, where social factors (i.e. Cooperative
   Learning) influence psychological mediators (i.e. relatedness), which
   mediate over the different types of motivation (i.e. intrinsic
   motivation) and finally lead to different outcomes (i.e.
   enjoyment).Conclusion: Cooperative Learning applied on a sustained basis
   can increase the most self-determined types of motivation, intrinsic
   motivation and identified regulation, in secondary education students.
   Students' perceptions after experiencing Cooperative Learning for a long
   period of time reflected four positive ideas: cooperation, relatedness,
   enjoyment and novelty and a negative one: disappointment. Both the
   positive and the negative ideas should be considered when implementing
   Cooperative Learning in physical education, because students experience
   them.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {Orientation: A lack of employability attributes is often suggested as
   one of the main reasons for the existing new graduate supply-demand gap.
   Research purpose: The study aimed to empirically explore managerial
   expectations of new graduate employability attributes and what managers
   are prepared to do to enable new graduates in this regard. Motivation
   for the study: Not being able to find qualified candidates hampers
   productivity. In addition, it also limits new graduates' prospects of
   finding sustainable employment. Research approach/design and method:
   This study is based on responses of 17 respondents from the North West,
   Gauteng and Northern Free State provinces of South Africa. Responses
   were obtained through a qualitative online survey. The researchers
   analysed the data using qualitative content analysis. Main findings: Six
   main attributes were extracted from the data: Being self-determined
   (making choices and managing their own lives); harnessing knowledge and
   learning (using and developing knowledge and skills); having a positive
   attitude (solving problems and dealing with challenges and setbacks);
   believing in oneself (having humility and selfconfidence); having good
   relationships with others (being sensitive towards the organisational
   culture and relating well to others) and managerial capacity building
   (managers' coaching and mentor roles that are critical to enable new
   graduates). Practical/managerial implications: Understanding managerial
   expectations should guide industry, higher education institutions and
   government in developing evidence-based interventions focussing on the
   relevant aspects of new graduate employability attributes.
   Contribution/value-add: The findings of this study provides an
   empirically grounded description of six broad new graduate attributes
   that managers value.},

Abstract = {Background: Self-directed learning or self-determined learning can be
   used in guided self-study (GSS) as an educational method with the goal
   to promote changes in the knowledge and skills of undergraduate
   physiotherapy students in higher education. Until now, there has been a
   lack of empirical evidence for the usage of GSS in physiotherapy higher
   education. At the Division of Physiotherapy in the Department of Health
   Professions (Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH), Switzerland) the
   module `basic examination' - in the form of an objective structured
   examination (OSCE) and written exam - is scheduled in the first semester
   of the educational program.
   Objective: The primary aim of this study is to examine the feasibility
   of establishing GSS in an undergraduate physiotherapy degree program at
   the BFH. Secondary aim is to assess the effectiveness of GSS on the
   examination skills of first-semester undergraduate physiotherapy
   students will.
   Method: This paper describes the protocol of a randomized
   group-controlled educational feasibility study. 51 physiotherapy
   students from the first semester will be allocated into a guided
   self-study group (GSSG) or control group. The GSS takes place during the
   first semester, and consists of an eight-day cycle, with a presentation
   on the last day. Duration of this presentation is 90min with supervision
   from a university lecturer. One week in advance of the presentation, the
   case and the learning goals are provided to the students electronically.
   The students prepare the cases in groups of five to six. The students
   are guided by the tutor during this preparation time. During a moderated
   plenum session, students present the results of group work and reflect
   upon the preparation phase and learning steps. Feasibility outcomes
   include the fidelity of implementation through exposure dosage,
   students' responsiveness, program differentiation, and the degree of
   acceptability. Success criteria of feasibility are (1) exposure dosage
   as the number of 90-minute presentations that are conducted, and the
   content of cases and competences, (2) students' responsiveness, with the
   aim of 100\% willingness to participate, and (3) program
   differentiation, which will illustrate the alignment between GSS case
   content and the curriculum. Acceptability of intervention from the
   students' perspective will be evaluated by a semi-structured interview.
   Secondary outcomes will be the achieved grades in the OSCE exams and
   written exams that demonstrate learning success.
   Conclusion: This feasibility study assesses the fidelity of
   implementation, the degree of acceptability and the effectiveness of GSS
   sessions on examination skills in undergraduate physiotherapy students
   at the BFH. Furthermore, this study will demonstrate whether guided
   self-study is feasible and can be implemented with fidelity in the BFH
   physiotherapy higher education curriculum.},

Title = {Academic Motivation Structures of Physiotherapy Students - Comparison of
   Extra-Occupational and Vocational In-Service Degree Programmes on the
   Basis of the Self-Determination Theory},

Abstract = {Background: Based on increasing academisation of physiotherapy in
   Germany it is fundamental for educational institutions and lecturers to
   know more about the motivational structures which agitate
   physiotherapists already employed or still on vocational training to
   start a study programme at a university of applied sciences.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the motivational
   structures of physiotherapists taking part in academic studies in
   different study models in Germany.
   Methods: As theoretical basis served the self-determination theory
   developed by Deci and Ryan {[}9]. The German version of Echelle de
   Motivation Dans Les Etude-Etudes Avancees by Vallerand l. {[}40, 41] was
   used to measure the attitudes towards 7 different motivation types.
   Results: Students at a German private university of applied sciences
   being already employed or still on vocational training show different
   motivations towards taking part in professional academic education. Both
   groups looked favourably upon the expected results of the study
   regarding future professional career development. Most of the students
   made widely autonomous decisions suggesting positive learning outcomes
   in terms of the self-determination theory.
   Conclusions: In the present study, motivational differences of
   physiotherapy students in 2 different studymodels at a private
   university of applied sciences in Germany were found. On the basis of an
   overall structure of autonomous motivation, already employed older
   students were more self-determined and intrinsically motivated than
   still on vocational training younger students who showed higher
   extrinsic motivation scores.},

Title = {Introspectiveness of Higher Education Students: Study and Development},
Journal = {PROPOSITOS Y REPRESENTACIONES},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The change in strategic guidelines in Russian education is associated
   with a revision of the goals of teaching and upbringing. However, the
   emphasis of reforms has shifted towards the formation of the required
   professional competences at this stage in the development of the
   education system of the Russian Federation. We think that it is possible
   to achieve the set goal of higher education through the development of
   the introspectiveness as a quality of the personality of students. The
   formation of the introspectiveness in a future specialist will have an
   effect on the successful mastery, expansion and transformation of social
   experience, as well as the internal plan of action. Thus, demonstrating
   the formed introspectiveness as a personality trait, the student is able
   to organize his educational activities independently, activities to
   cognize the surrounding reality and his inner world, as well as
   self-determine in various life situations, including the development of
   general cultural and professional competences. In this regard, the
   emphasis in the issue of developing the introspectiveness of students is
   made on specifying the conditions that must be created at a higher
   education institution for the manifestation and formation of this
   personality quality. The purpose of the article is to study the level of
   the introspectiveness of university students and develop psychological
   and pedagogical conditions that develop this personality quality. The
   leading techniques for the study of this problem were the following:
   Q-sort Technique; the technique for diagnostics of an individual measure
   of the introspectiveness degree. At the stage of the ascertaining
   experiment, the levels of the introspectiveness of university students
   were revealed. The results of the ascertaining experiment convincingly
   demonstrated the need to organize special work to develop the
   introspectiveness of students. The authors substantiated that the
   success of developing students' introspectiveness is ensured by the
   created psychological and pedagogical conditions. A model of developing
   the introspectiveness as a personality quality of a future professional
   has been developed and tested. The results of this study create
   opportunities for further development of the problem in the context of
   the organization of lectures in the learning process for students of
   different courses and types of specialization. The article is intended
   for psychologists, tutors, education managers.},

Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this research is to evaluate the factors
   that influence the motivation of students of Accounting course of a
   Higher Education Institution (HEI) located in Minas Gerais, in the light
   of the Self-Determination Theory.
   Methodology: To assess the motivation of the students, 70 students in
   the first year of the Accounting course and 100 students enrolled in the
   8th, 9th and 10th semester of the undergraduate course under analysis,
   that is, in the final phase of the course, composed the sample of this
   study by completing a questionnaire containing the Brazilian version of
   the Academic Motivation Scale (EMA), consisting of 29 questions.
   Results: It was possible to infer, through the avarages found for the
   factors, that the students of the initial phase of the course are more
   self-determined and intrinsically motivated than unmotivated with the
   academic path. Regarding the motivation of respondents at the end of
   graduation, compared to the motivation of individuals enrolled in the
   initial phase of the course, it was found that most of them are more
   unmotivated at the end of graduation.
   Study Contributions: In view of the results found, it is up to the
   coordination of the course, together with the teachers, to reflect on
   the curricular adequacy, aiming to meet the students' desires. Likewise,
   it is up to teachers to improve didactics and teaching methodology, with
   a view to meeting the needs of students, as well as providing a
   favorable environment for learning. It is believed these are some
   measures that will contribute to increase the level of motivation of
   students in the Accounting course and, consequently, improve the degree
   of satisfaction of these individuals with regard to the degree offered
   by the HEI under analysis.},

Title = {Supporting Subject Justification by Educational Psychology: A Systematic
   Review of Achievement Goal Motivation in School Physical Education},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUL 17},
Abstract = {Achievement Goal Theory (AGT) has been applied as a core concept for
   understanding and promoting students' motivation in physical education
   (PE) and shows considerable relevance for theoretically and empirically
   justifying the significance of PE. However, systematically organized
   reviews of empirical research on AGT are limited to physical activities
   without explicit PE perspective. First, we aimed to compile basic tenets
   of AGT and its pedagogical potential for PE. Second, to bring together
   key findings and discuss future research, we systematically examined the
   existing empirical literature that applied AGT constructs in both
   observational and interventional PE settings. We searched the Web of
   Science, Scopus, Education Source, ERIC, SPORTDiscus, Physical Education
   Index, PsychInfo, and PsychArticles databases to identify
   English-language peer-reviewed journal articles with no restriction to
   publication date. The review was conducted according to the PRISMA
   Statement. Two independent reviewers screened all studies identified for
   eligibility, and assessed the methodological quality as well as the risk
   of bias. A total of 91 studies were included for analysis. Most of the
   studies (70) were observational, 21 studies were intervention based. On
   average, the methodological quality of the included studies was moderate
   and the risk of bias was moderate to high. Mastery goals,
   mastery-approach goals, and mastery climates appear to be highly
   relevant for supporting multiple political and curricular PE aims such
   as psychological well-being, motor skill development, general sports
   participation, prosocial behavior, and aspects of healthy living.
   Achievement goal profiles combining high mastery goals, high to low
   performance goals, and performance-approach goals partly show desirable
   functions. The results provide comprehensive information for planning
   and shaping PE lessons based on AGT constructs that match the intended
   ambitions. The integration of the results into everyday school PE
   practice is a promising avenue for promoting students' motivation in PE
   and for fulfilling the overall political and curricular aims. However,
   this may be challenging in PE practice, as PE teachers at least
   partially follow a performance-pedagogical structure, including an
   orientation toward agonal sports, competition, and social comparison.},

Abstract = {Digital open badges (e.g. Mozilla Open Badges) offer novel possibilities
   in identifying and recognising competences independent of how they were
   acquired. Digital open badge-driven learning suggests to enhance
   learning by promoting inspiring gamified competence-development. This
   paper offers a summary of the first European doctoral dissertation to
   represent an innovative application of competence-based approach and
   gamified learning process. The summary aims to address recent
   theoretical approaches to digital open badge-driven learning and
   principles for designing gamification with badges that could potentially
   support a competence-based approach in continuing professional
   development to meet the individual professional needs. The research
   aimed to explore vocational teachers' different ideas, views and
   experiences of the competence-based approach to professional development
   of digital pedagogical competences; it also sought to investigate the
   structure and process of digital open badge-driven learning. The data
   were collected from Finnish pre- and in-service vocational teachers
   (n=29) in 2016 via group online interviews (n=6) and via online
   questionnaires in 2017 (n=329). The study draws on descriptive mixed
   research methodologies: qualitative content analysis, phenomenography
   and a novel application of descriptive statistical methodology
   (constrained correspondence analysis) to the context of educational
   research. The results culminate in defining digital open badge-driven
   learning process grounded on the badge constellation of competences.
   This paper offers to summarise findings of different sub-studies
   emphasising gamification of competence-development. First, gamified
   criterion-based challenges arouse and maintain interest until the
   intended competence is achieved. Second, flexible study options support
   self-determined studying and prompt the desired learning action,
   allowing students to self-select the time and place of learning. Third,
   the option to customise studies represents another central principle:
   personalised study paths arouse interest and maintain students'
   motivation and engagement as their studies progress. Further,
   inspirational play through gamification encourages students to continue
   their studies after completing an initial task even towards the highest
   possible skills set level; this motivation is particularly apparent when
   they are given the option to personalise their study paths entirely. The
   triggers of the learning process appear more versatile than the triggers
   of gamification or online-learning alone. In terms of digital open
   badge-driven learning, the prompting trigger for learning might be
   realised at different stages of the learning process in various forms,
   including community building and collaboration facilitated by
   gamification, scaffolding or criterion-based challenges.},

Title = {The baroreceptor reflex brought to life outside the classroom - an
   e-learning based asynchronous laboratory class using a non-supervised
   modified Active Standing Test},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Background: E-learning based laboratory classes can replace or enhance
   in-classroom laboratories. They typically offer temporal flexibility,
   self-determined learning speed, repeatability and do not require
   supervision or face-to-face contact. The aim of this feasibility study
   was to investigate whether the established in-classroom laboratory class
   on the baroreceptor reflex (BRR) can be transformed into a new
   e-learning based asynchronous laboratory class for untrained,
   non-supervised students without medical equipment. The BRR is a
   fundamental cardiovascular process which is regularly visualized in
   physiology during in-classroom laboratories by a student-performed
   Active Standing Test (AST). During this voluntary provocation of
   orthostatic stress, the BRR reliably causes a solid rise in heart rate
   (HR) and a stabilization or even increase in blood pressure (BP).
   Methods: The conventional AST was modified by omission of BP
   measurements which would require medical devices and was embedded into a
   framework of interactive digital material allowing independent student
   performance. With specific adaptions, this instrument was implemented to
   1st and 2nd year curricula of human medicine, dental medicine, midwifery
   and pharmacy. An audience response system was used to collect the
   students' data on HR, epidemiology, technical problems, satisfaction and
   orthostatic symptoms. As primary outcome, we investigated the students'
   correct performance of the modified AST regarding textbook conformity of
   the HR data. Secondary outcomes included technical feasibility, the
   students'satisfaction and consistency of HR data within predefined
   subgroups (e.g., gender, curricula). Descriptive statistics are
   reported.
   Results: The class was completed by 217 students (mean age: 23 +/- 8
   {[}SD], 81\% female, 19\% male). Mean reported rise of HR during
   standing was similar to 20 bpm (similar to 30\%) which is highly
   concordant to textbooks. Reported feasibility (similar to 80\% negated
   any technical issues) and students'satisfaction (4.4 on 5-point
   Likert-scale) were high. The HR data were consistent within the
   subgroups.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the highly relevant BRR can be
   successfully addressed in an e-learning based asynchronous laboratory
   class implementing a non-supervised AST restricted to HR measurements
   embedded in digital material. The robust HR response and the adjustable

Title = {An interventional study with the Maldives generalist teachers in primary
   school physical education: An application of self-determination theory},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {In Maldives' primary schools, physical education (PE) is mainly taught
   by generalist classroom teachers who often lack knowledge and confidence
   to teach PE. Also, PE programs in primary schools are affected by a
   perceived lack of infrastructure, resources and equipment. Children in
   primary schools are allocated one 35 minute period of PE per week.
   Researchers have previously investigated interventions implemented by
   specialist PE teachers to enhance the motivation of secondary school
   students in PE classes. However, limited research has been conducted
   with generalist teachers' implementing PE intervention with primary
   school children. In this study we applied self-determination theory to
   investigate the effects of a professional learning program and an
   associated resource support package, that was then delivered by the
   Maldives generalist teachers' delivering PE. The participants were 30
   primary school teachers (control group, n = 15; intervention group, n =
   15), and their 725 primary school students aged 9-12 years (mean age of
   10.5 years). The teachers in the group undertook eight hours of
   professional learning that focused on strategies and behaviours to
   support student satisfaction for the three main elements of
   self-determination theory: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. A
   repeated measure ANCOVA was carried out for each of the dependent
   variables. Overall results when compared to pre-intervention measures,
   the students of teachers in the intervention group significantly
   increased their post-intervention perceptions for autonomy, competence,
   and relatedness; and, increased their psychological need satisfaction.
   Moreover, intervention-students in the post-intervention phase reported
   reduced need frustration for autonomy, competence, and relatedness; and,
   experienced higher levels of self-efficacy, enjoyment and engagement. We
   contend that these results accentuate the usefulness of professional
   learning programs for generalist teachers delivering PE to promote
   students' psychological need satisfaction, whilst reducing thwarting
   behaviours to enhance students' self-determined motivation toward PE
   classes. The intervention program significantly enhanced the students'
   perceived need support, and autonomous motivation, it also reduced
   teachers' need frustrating behaviours within PE classes. Facilitating
   teachers to provide more moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)
   and psychological need support could reduce the rate of non-communicable
   diseases that are currently prevalent in the Maldives.},

Title = {Virtual inverted classroom to replace in-person radiology lectures at
   the time of the COVID-19 pandemic-a prospective evaluation and historic
   comparison},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 11},
Abstract = {Background In the time of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   pandemic, in-person lectures had to be shifted to online learning. This
   study aimed to evaluate students' and lecturers' perception and
   effectiveness of a virtual inverted classroom (VIC) concept on clinical
   radiology in comparison to a historic control. Methods In the winter
   semester 2020/21, 136 fourth year medical students who completed the
   clinical radiology VIC during the pandemic, were included in the single
   centre, prospective study. Results were compared with a historic control
   that had finished the physical inverted classroom (PIC) in the
   immediately preceding year. The VIC consisted of an initial phase of
   self-determined preparation with learning videos and a second
   interactive phase of clinical case studies alternating between the
   virtual lecture hall and virtual buzz groups. At the end of the lecture
   series, students rated the lecture on a scale of 1 (most positive
   assessment) to 6 (most negative assessment) through an online survey
   platform. Additionally, they reported their impressions in free-form
   text. Lecturers were invited to comment on the VIC in a group interview.
   Main outcomes were final grades and student perception of the VIC.
   Results Students' general impression of VIC was lower than that of PIC
   (median value of 3 {[}IQR 4, 2] and 1 {[}IQR 0, 0], p < 0.001),
   respectively, p < 0.001). The highest rating was achieved concerning use
   of the audience response system (median 1 {[}IQR 1, 0]), and the lowest
   concerning the buzz groups (median 4 {[}IQR 5, 3]). Students stated that
   they would have appreciated more details on reading images, greater
   focus on plenary case studies, and provision of exam related scripts.
   Lecturers would have liked better preparation by students, more activity
   of students, and stronger assistance for group support. Exam grades
   after VIC were better than after PIC (median 1 {[}IQR 2, 1] and 2 {[}IQR
   2,1], respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusions Students' overall perception
   of VIC was satisfactory, although worse than PIC. Final grades improved
   compared to PIC. Provided an adapted buzz group size and support, VIC
   may serve as complement in medical education once the pandemic is over.},

Title = {Education in economics in the frame of the subject ``Geography and
   Economic Education{''} between orientation towards daily life and
   economistic approaches - Partial results of an empirical study},

Abstract = {Education in economics in the frame of the subject ``Geography and
   Economic Education{''} between orientation towards daily life and
   economistic approaches Partial results of an empirical study
   Our life is to a high extent penetrated by the economy. Economic
   education should therefore enable young people to act in a
   self-determined and responsible way in a democratic setting to orientate
   themselves, to shape opinions and to act. Knowledge is also necessary,
   but not exclusively. Tests usually just evaluate the capacity to
   memorise and at the best the capacity to connect matters, but not the
   abilities mentioned above. Comparing the two basic paradigms of economic
   education, i.e., economistic (categorical) education and everyday
   life-oriented socio-economic education, makes clear that in the subject
   ``Geography and Economic Education{''} as well as in the didactics of
   Geography and Economic Education, the essential
   society-space-economy-context is compatible to the latter paradigm.
   Thus, the didactically legitimate choice of topics in the paradigm of
   socio-economic education is based primarily on four subject areas:
   private household, consumption, work and society. Especially at the
   lower secondary level, to a lesser extent also at the higher secondary
   level of schools providing general education, socio-economic education
   is not understood to be just a reduced version of business economics and
   macroeconomics.
   To which extent this orientation is practised at the lower secondary
   level was the central question of an empirical study (n = 527) conducted
   at Viennese schools (New Secondary Schools as well as Lower Level
   Academic Secondary Schools). This study surveyed also the teachers'
   perception of the significance as well as the difficulty of teaching
   economic topics. Analysis was performed using qualitative content
   analysis and contextual analysis.
   Results related to the estimated importance of economic topics show that
   for 54\% of the respondents ``society economy{''} is the most important
   topic, with a big gap followed by ``labour economics{''} and
   ``consumption economics{''}. Economy of private households, the primary
   living environment for children and adolescents, is obviously of little
   importance for teachers. When teachers highlighted economic subjects
   difficult to teach, they referred at a rate of 81\% again to ``society
   economy{''}.
   For Geography and Economic Education instruction in schools the
   following three conclusions are drawn: (I) Schools should take advantage
   of their contacts to professionals and enterprises. (2) References to
   everyday life and the living environment of pupils are inherent to
   almost all economic themes and questions and should be activated. (3)
   Since no certain answer is available to several questions,
   controversially designed learning environments should be preferred. As
   confirmed by this study, all this is already implemented at the lower
   secondary level, but needs to be intensified and expanded.},

Title = {Planning and Implementation of Guided Self-study in an Undergraduate
   Physiotherapy Curriculum in Switzerland-A Feasibility Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Self-directed learning (andragogy) or self-determined
   learning (heutagogy) can be implemented in guided self-study (GSS) with
   the aim to foster changes in the knowledge and skills of physiotherapy
   students in a higher education setting. To date, there is a lack of
   evidence for the use of GSS in higher education for physiotherapy.
   Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of developing and
   implementing GSS in an undergraduate physiotherapy educational program
   in Switzerland. In addition, the effectiveness of GSS in bringing
   changes in knowledge and skills was assessed.
   Method: Full-time undergraduate physiotherapy students (n = 49) from the
   third semester volunteered in this feasibility study. Students were
   randomly allocated into a GSS group or a control group (CG) in the
   period from October to November 2019. The GSS group prepared a total of
   3 clinical cases. Each case was processed in an 8-day cycle. On day 1,
   the clinical case (ie, description of a patient and symptoms) and
   learning goals were provided to the students electronically. The
   students prepared the cases in groups from days 2 to 7. They were guided
   2 times by the tutor (physical meeting and via Skype) during this
   preparation phase. The results of group work were presented and
   reflected on during a moderated plenum session (90 minutes) on day 8.
   The feasibility of this higher education study was operationalized as
   follows: exposure ({''}dose,{''} ie, the number of GSS sessions
   performed over 90 minutes, as well as the content of the cases and the
   learning objectives); students' responsiveness, with an a priori set
   100\% willingness to participate on day 8; program differentiation, to
   illustrate differences between the content of GSS cases and the
   curriculum; and degree of acceptability. In addition, an assessment was
   made of the total scores in the objective structured clinical
   examination (OSCE) and written examinations, as well as the amount of
   GSS. Statistical analyses were conducted using an intention-to-treat
   approach.
   Results: All 3 GSS sessions on day 8 lasted the scheduled 90 minutes.
   The content of the presented cases was aligned with the learning
   objectives. The responsiveness of students willing to participate on day
   8 was 42\%. In program differentiation, no differences in content were
   found between the GSS presentation content and the usual curriculum
   content when compared with the learning aims. Objective structured
   clinical examination grades and written examination grades were similar
   for the GSS and CG. The analysis of the focus group interview showed a
   low degree of acceptability indicating that the students' workload was
   high during the GSS period.
   Conclusions: This study showed that this GSS program for undergraduate
   physiotherapy students in its current form is ``feasible with
   modification.{''} Modification of the study protocol (eg, better time
   planning in the academic calendar) is needed to improve the students'
   responsiveness. Alternatively, classroom hours may be reduced to favor
   self-study time. Such adjustments to the timetable should allow the
   physiotherapy students to better prepare the clinical cases. The
   effectiveness of the GSS and normal curriculum on OSCE and written
   examination scores was similar, probably due to the observed low
   students' acceptability},

Title = {Quantitative insights into meaningful physical education in Spain:
   students' perceptions across gender and grade levels},
Journal = {PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAY 21},
Abstract = {Background: Over the last few years, the Meaningful Physical Education
   (PE) approach has emerged as a framework aimed at transforming PE
   experiences into relevant and positive for all students. To date, most
   of the existing research on Meaningful PE has been conducted in
   English-speaking contexts, using qualitative research designs and mainly
   on teachers. This focus has left three notable gaps that the present
   study tried to address: the use of quantitative research designs, the
   exploration of the framework in other cultural contexts, and a focus on
   students' perceptions. In addition, factors like gender and school
   level, which significantly influence how students perceive and value the
   subject, remain underexplored. For this study, the Meaningful PE
   features identified in the Spanish context were included (i.e. social
   interaction, challenge, personally relevant learning, fun, motor
   competence, novelty, teacher interpersonal style, and relief). Purpose:
   The present study aimed to address three main research gaps: (1) to
   analyse the relationships between the eight Meaningful PE features using
   a quantitative design, (2) to explore potential differences based on
   students' gender, (3) and to examine differences across school years.
   Method: A quantitative research methodology with a cross-sectional
   design was employed. Data were collected through the Meaningful PE scale
   (a questionnaire designed to assess students' perceptions of the eight
   features), where participants provided self-reported responses. The
   study involved 535 secondary education students, including 261 males
   (48.8\%) and 274 females (51.2\%), with an average age of 13.48 years
   (SD = 1.64). Participants were drawn from grades 8-12. First,
   descriptive and correlational analyses were performed. Then, demographic
   statistics and differences were calculated for the total sample, male
   and female participants. Findings: Results showed that the overall
   Meaningful PE scale showed strong positive correlations with features
   such as Fun (r = .88), Adaptive Teaching Style (r = .89), and Clarifying
   Teaching Style (r = .88). Motor Competence was linked with Challenge (r
   = .71) and Fun (r = .64). Social Interaction with the Teacher was
   strongly associated with Adaptive Teaching Style (r = .81) and Guiding
   Teaching Style (r = .83). Regarding differences based on gender, the
   global Meaningful PE score did not differ significantly, but Social
   Interaction with Peers (M = 4.60, SD = 1.10, p < .01), Personally
   Relevant Learning (M = 4.26, SD = 1.30, p = .02), Motor Competence (M =
   4.80, SD = 1.12, p < .01) and Relief (M = 4.66, SD = 1.21, p = .03) were
   higher for males. Descriptive analyses revealed significant differences
   across the school years, but these differences did not follow a
   consistent pattern, suggesting that other contextual or individual
   factors may play a more influential role, for example class size ratio.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, teachers should consider the eight features
   of Meaningful PE (as reflected in the twelve factors analysed) when
   planning to promote a meaningful PE context. The observed gender
   differences highlighted the need for tailored pedagogical approaches
   that address specific barriers faced by female students and/or different
   age groups.},
